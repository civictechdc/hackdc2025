## Project Evaluations

### Project: LLM.gov

**Scores (0–5 scale):**

* Impact & Relevance (20%): 5/5
* Novelty (20%): 4/5
* Amplification (15%): 5/5
* Open Source Practices (15%): 5/5
* Usability & Design (15%): 4/5
* Continuity Potential (15%): 5/5

**Comments:**

I work a lot with this kind of architecture in the context of known documentation sets. I think this is a natural place to go for public comment analysis because semantic search capability will supercharge the ability of users to interface with the content.

I am curious if the more challenging parts of these data are vectorizable in a consistent and useful way. For example, public comments that contain data tables or relevant numeric information. What sort of preprocessing might we employ to identify the public comments that are most interoperable with this technology stack? What do we do with the public comments that will pollute the vector database and draw down the quality of the semantic search at large?

I really love a quick, useful, utility that expands functionality of an existing tool. I think we should highly value contributions like this.

**Comments:**

I thought the interface really took this project to the next level. I think there's a lot more that can be done with this to make it even more useful. I think the current implementation won't have too much impact because of how the groupings were created. I think trying to use LLMs as a way to topic model a corpus is a great use case, but it does require passing large parts of that corpus to the models which can be challenging if the corpus is too large or runs into issues with the context windows of your target models. One could leverage a catch all category if you know you want to capture certain types of comments and don't care too much about ones that deviate from that space. User centered design principles can be very useful in helping take this to the next level.

It might be better to create known classification frameworks for comment types then have the LLM bucket comments into that pre-existing framework. This requires a lot of domain knowledge and upfront work, but once it gets going it is extremely powerful.

Thanks for your hard work!

## Scoring Notes

As a reminder, here's what each category evaluates:

* **Impact & Relevance (20%)**: Tackles an official problem statement with civic value
* **Novelty (20%)**: Unique or creative approach
* **Amplification (15%)**: Potential for adoption, scaling, or integration
* **Open Source Practices (15%)**: Public repo, OSI license, documentation, contributions
* **Usability & Design (15%)**: Non-technical users can interpret or use outputs effectively
* **Continuity Potential (15%)**: Roadmap, maintainers, and clear next steps for continued work
