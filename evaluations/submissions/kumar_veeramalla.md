## Project Scores

### Project: canOfSpam

* **Impact & Relevance (20%):** 4/5
* **Novelty (20%):** 2.5/5
* **Amplification (15%):** 2.5/5
* **Open Source Practices (15%):** 3/5
* **Usability & Design (15%):** 2/5
* **Continuity Potential (15%):** 3/5
* **Comments:**

  * The core idea is good, but the approach needs significant changes to support large datasets.
  * The comparison is using o(n2) (Sequential processing), which is not suit for large datasets and reduces the performance.
  * Hardcoded values like the similarity threshold should be parameterized to enhance flexibility and reusability.
  * No mention of lowercase,uppercase,stop word removal. This can reduce accuracy of detection and Lack on Error handling.
  * It can be further enhanced to use it widely and support multi-language comments similarity checks.

### Project: entity-resolution-team

* **Impact & Relevance (20%):** 2/5
* **Novelty (20%):** 2/5
* **Amplification (15%):** 2/5
* **Open Source Practices (15%):** 1.5/5
* **Usability & Design (15%):** 2/5
* **Continuity Potential (15%):** 1.5/5
* **Comments:**

  * Lacks clear documentation, making it hard to understand and reuse.
  * The code is not production-ready, as it currently exists in a Jupyter notebook.
  * Adding meaningful comments to explain the logic would greatly improve readability.
  * The idea is valuable for analyzing organizational comments, but the current implementation makes it hard to adopt.

### Project: hive-partitioned-parquet

* **Impact & Relevance (20%):** 5/5
* **Novelty (20%):** 4/5
* **Amplification (15%):** 4/5
* **Open Source Practices (15%):** 3/5
* **Usability & Design (15%):** 3/5
* **Continuity Potential (15%):** 4/5
* **Comments:**

  * The core idea is very solid and the use of parquet and Hive partitioning is smart and scalable approach.Choosing DuckDB is a good decision for lightweight.
  * The inclusion of demo notebook provides clear value and practical demonstration.
  * This approach is good for small and medium data but will not work for Large scala data.
  * Lack of schema evolution and advanced features which are already are available in market such as Delta Lake/Apache Iceberg which even handles Time travel, schema evaluation, ACID transactions.
