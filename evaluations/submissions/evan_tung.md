## Project Evaluations

### Project: Hive-partitioned Parquet

**Team:** Jay Qi

**Scores (0–5 scale):**

* Impact & Relevance (20%): 4/5
* Novelty (20%): 4/5
* Amplification (15%): 5/5
* Open Source Practices (15%): 3/5
* Usability & Design (15%): 2/5
* Continuity Potential (15%): 3/5

**Comments:**
The thing that stood out to me was definitely the speed of the queries executed on the Hive-partitioned parquet tables. During the live demo, it was amazing to see how the query could be executed against a remote S3 bucket without having to download the entire dataset. The README instructions are pretty well written as well, so any technical person could continue this without any problem. However it would be pretty difficult for a non-technical person to use this.

### Project: LLM.gov (CMS Docket Assistant)

**Team:** LLM.gov

**Scores (0–5 scale):**

* Impact & Relevance (20%): 5/5
* Novelty (20%): 2/5
* Amplification (15%): 4/5
* Open Source Practices (15%): 3/5
* Usability & Design (15%): 5/5
* Continuity Potential (15%): 3/5

**Comments:**

I really like how usable this project was for non-technical users, and the fact that example questions were added helps that factor even more. I can definitely foresee the general public using this to ask questions about recent regulations. However, a RAG-based chatbot is one of the more standard applications of generative AI, and I would have liked to see some more creative applications of it. As it currently stands, the user also has to know how to run a set of bespoke CLI scripts in the correct order to run the CMS chatbot, so I would like to see that maintainability aspect improved.

### Project: FCC & SEC Web Scraping

**Team:** The Scrapers

**Scores (0–5 scale):**

* Impact & Relevance (20%): 5/5
* Novelty (20%): 3/5
* Amplification (15%): 4/5
* Open Source Practices (15%): 2/5
* Usability & Design (15%): 2/5
* Continuity Potential (15%): 3/5

**Comments:**

This was definitely a high-impact project in that we now have the possibility to add non-Regulations.gov data sources to the Mirrulations dataset. Figuring out how the SEC and FCC APIs/websites work in order to scrape them will definitely help us in the future. However, I would have like to see better Open Source Practices with more instructions on how to use the project.
