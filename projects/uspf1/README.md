**Team:** USPF1  
**Hackathon:** Civic Hack DC 2025  
**Challenge:** Regulatory Document Discovery & Navigation / Usability for Non‚ÄëTechnical Stakeholders

**Description:**
Check out the full [project readme](./upstream/README.md) for more details.

## üí° Solution

An automated classification system that analyzes FDA docket comments and generates tags indicating the type of information needed (Scientific/Technical, Policy/Regulatory, Procedural, etc.). The system helps identify which dockets require specific types of clarification from the FDA.

## üîç Key Findings

Analysis of FDA docket comments revealed:

- 270 comments requested Scientific/Technical information (largest category)
- 134 comments requested Policy/Recommendation information  
- 85 comments requested Policy/Regulatory information
- Additional categories include Procedural, Administrative, and Regulatory Change requests

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

Python-based text analysis system that processes FDA docket comments and generates classification tags to improve document accessibility and highlight relevant dockets for specific stakeholder needs.
