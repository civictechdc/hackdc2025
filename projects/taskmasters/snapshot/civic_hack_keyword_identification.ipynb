I support rescheduling.<br/><br/>It&#39;s been proven that people get heavily addicted to opiates and painkillers prescribed by their doctor. Several reports of individuals moving on to harder drugs such as heroin after their doctors cut off their prescription have been noted. People kill people over drugs such as this, but not marijuana. No one goes into life threatening withdrawal if they aren&#39;t able to get marijuana. No one goes out and kills someone to get a hit of marijuana. <br/><br/>Reschedule marijuana and work toward legalizing it. Use the tax revenue toward supporting our communities and properly educating our children about the true effects of drugs so they can be safe.   \n",
              "1  Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.<br/><br/>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. <br/><br/>The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use. <br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana is unscientific and harmful. I ask that you recognize the downfalls of this type of policy and keep marijuana as a Schedule I drug.   \n",

              "4  Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

Several reports of individuals moving on to harder drugs such as heroin after their doctors cut off their prescription have been noted. People kill people over drugs such as this, but not marijuana. No one goes into life threatening withdrawal if they aren&amp;#39;t able to get marijuana. No one goes out and kills someone to get a hit of marijuana. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reschedule marijuana and work toward legalizing it.

              "      <td>Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&amp;rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&amp;rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&amp;rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&amp;rsquo;s time to end this country&amp;rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&amp;rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&amp;rsquo; access to medical marijuana. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&amp;rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &amp;ldquo;descheduling.&amp;rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&amp;rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the Biden Administration&amp;rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&amp;rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.</td>\n",

              "      <td>As an American citizen, I am concerned with the Drug Enforcement Administration&amp;rsquo;s proposal to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug. Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rescheduling marijuana is unscientific and harmful. I ask that you recognize the downfalls of this type of policy and keep marijuana as a Schedule I drug.</td>\n",

This drug is very powerful and just doing this re-classification helps to normalize it in society. Look at EVERY state in the U.S. where it has been legalized and made more available and more accessible: it is horrific the increase in crime, homelessness, worklessness, motor vehicle accidents and fatalities, etc. Please do not change the schedule according to the CSA guidelines. Marijuana is NOT medicine and is not therapeutic in any way.<br/><br/>I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. <br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco&rsquo;s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. <br/><br/>HHS&#39; recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, &ldquo;using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.&rdquo; <br/><br/>With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21&ndash;30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. <br/><br/>Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, &ldquo;adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.&rdquo;  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, &ldquo;Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.&rdquo; Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, &ldquo;researchers are still studying how long marijuana&rsquo;s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Finally, while some states recognize &ldquo;medical marijuana&rdquo; there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that &ldquo;encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.&rdquo; <br/><br/>I encourage you to follow the science and public health evidence on this issue and keep marijuana in Schedule I.\",\n          \"Anyone who wants marijuana can get it either by legal or illegal means. Getting it illegally hurts all of us! We need to decriminalize it. Rescheduling, although a step in the right direction, is NOT enough!!!<br/><br/>BTW, I do not use marijuana myself, even when I can get it legally. However, I have felt for a long time, it is time to keep Americans from getting in trouble with the law for this. The resources spent on policing it, can be spent elsewhere that REALLY matter. <br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Charles Comeaux\",\n          \"Official Comment Drug Enforcement Agency ,<br/><br/>I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation&#39;s drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis&#39; potential benefits and harms.<br/><br/>For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.<br/><br/>Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.<br/><br/>I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence.

              "top     Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

              "      <td>Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&amp;rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&amp;rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&amp;rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&amp;rsquo;s time to end this country&amp;rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&amp;rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&amp;rsquo; access to medical marijuana. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&amp;rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &amp;ldquo;descheduling.&amp;rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&amp;rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the Biden Administration&amp;rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&amp;rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.</td>\n",

I support rescheduling.<br/><br/>It&#39;s been proven that people get heavily addicted to opiates and painkillers prescribed by their doctor. Several reports of individuals moving on to harder drugs such as heroin after their doctors cut off their prescription have been noted. People kill people over drugs such as this, but not marijuana. No one goes into life threatening withdrawal if they aren&#39;t able to get marijuana. No one goes out and kills someone to get a hit of marijuana. <br/><br/>Reschedule marijuana and work toward legalizing it. Use the tax revenue toward supporting our communities and properly educating our children about the true effects of drugs so they can be safe.   \n",
              "1  Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.<br/><br/>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. <br/><br/>The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use. <br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana is unscientific and harmful. I ask that you recognize the downfalls of this type of policy and keep marijuana as a Schedule I drug.   \n",

              "4  Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

I support rescheduling.It's been proven that people get heavily addicted to opiates and painkillers prescribed by their doctor. Several reports of individuals moving on to harder drugs such as heroin after their doctors cut off their prescription have been noted. People kill people over drugs such as this, but not marijuana. No one goes into life threatening withdrawal if they aren't able to get marijuana. No one goes out and kills someone to get a hit of marijuana. Reschedule marijuana and work toward legalizing it. Use the tax revenue toward supporting our communities and properly educating our children about the true effects of drugs so they can be safe.   \n",
              "1  Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEAs proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administrations efforts to reconsider marijuanas inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, its time to end this countrys failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSAs drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations, immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients access to medical marijuana. Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it wont give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or descheduling. Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuanas status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.Given the Biden Administrations repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Bidens campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use. Rescheduling marijuana is unscientific and harmful. I ask that you recognize the downfalls of this type of policy and keep marijuana as a Schedule I drug.   \n",

              "4  Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEAs proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administrations efforts to reconsider marijuanas inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, its time to end this countrys failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSAs drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations, immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients access to medical marijuana. Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it wont give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or descheduling. Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuanas status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.Given the Biden Administrations repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Bidens campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&amp;rsquo; access to medical marijuana. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&amp;rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &amp;ldquo;descheduling.&amp;rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&amp;rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the Biden Administration&amp;rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&amp;rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.</td>\n",

While I appreciate the Biden Administrations efforts to reconsider marijuanas inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, its time to end this countrys failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSAs drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations, immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients access to medical marijuana. Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it wont give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or descheduling. Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuanas status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.Given the Biden Administrations repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Bidens campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"textblob_sentiment_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.10967495754272287,\n        \"min\": -1.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8555,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6939697265625,\n          -0.078125\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I support rescheduling.It's been proven that people get heavily addicted to opiates and painkillers prescribed by their doctor. Several reports of individuals moving on to harder drugs such as heroin after their doctors cut off their prescription have been noted. People kill people over drugs such as this, but not marijuana. No one goes into life threatening withdrawal if they aren't able to get marijuana. No one goes out and kills someone to get a hit of marijuana. Reschedule marijuana and work toward legalizing it. Use the tax revenue toward supporting our communities and properly educating our children about the true effects of drugs so they can be safe.   \n",
              "1      Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEAs proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administrations efforts to reconsider marijuanas inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, its time to end this countrys failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSAs drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations, immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients access to medical marijuana. Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it wont give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or descheduling. Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuanas status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.Given the Biden Administrations repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Bidens campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use. Rescheduling marijuana is unscientific and harmful. I ask that you recognize the downfalls of this type of policy and keep marijuana as a Schedule I drug.   \n",

              "4      Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEAs proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administrations efforts to reconsider marijuanas inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, its time to end this countrys failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSAs drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations, immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients access to medical marijuana. Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it wont give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or descheduling. Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuanas status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.Given the Biden Administrations repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Bidens campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 and its subsequent prohibition had nothing to do with public health or smoking of the THC rich flower strains we associate with marijuana. It was purely a business lobbyists' ploy to eradicate hemp as it was the primary competition of the recently invented Nylon (rope), cotton (fabric), and wood pulp (paper). They lobbied the US Government, created a propaganda campaign, and the Big Lie was born. What many people don't realize is that up until then cannabis was such an important textile that farms were mandated to grow it.Its classification as a Schedule 1 narcotic under the Controlled Substance Act in 1970, advocated for by then President Richard Nixon (there's a trustworthy guy ;), was a political ploy to allow for the continued harassment and unwarranted incarceration of minorities following the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's. The US government then put pressure on the rest of the world to follow suit.The late, great Robin Williams said it perfectly; If the most dangerous thing about a 'drug' is getting caught with it, there's a real problem.Tens of millions of people and their families have been hurt due to their unfair incarceration for marijuana related offenses. In addition, countless innocent people have lost their lives as a result of the War on Drugs and its bolstering of gangs and cartels (by legalizing it the cartels have no business). Meanwhile the vast majority of the world has missed out on the many health benefits of cannabis-derived compounds and earth friendly hemp textiles.Today the Cannabis Industry is thriving in states where it has been legalized and thousands of businesses, who pay more than their fair share of federal, state, and local taxes, are employing hundreds of thousands of people while providing state tested, safe cannabis products. However, these businesses do not have the same tax deductions that other businesses are entitled to. Also, they do not have access to traditional financial services, such as banking and credit card transactions, and therefore are the target of criminals due to the cash nature of its commerce.We have let our governments brain wash us for too long. Lets be done.   \n",
              "42809  Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEAs proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administrations efforts to reconsider marijuanas inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, its time to end this countrys failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSAs drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations, immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients access to medical marijuana. Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it wont give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or descheduling. Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuanas status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.Given the Biden Administrations repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Bidens campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

We have no such guidelines for measuring the amount of marijuana one can smoke/ingest and drive safely. Shouldn't we have those in place BEFORE we reschedule the classification of marijuana? It does make sense that we work toward the legalization of marijuana, but so much needs to be put in place first, especially standards for safe driving.My cousin was killed by a driver who was stoned. Please consider this.   \n",

By descheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup pollsupport cannabis legalization. But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health  Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someones ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. The criminalization of cannabisa legacy of the War on Drugswas a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. Its time to abandon this draconian approach. I support descheduling cannabis from the CSAa step toward righting the wrongs of its criminalization.   \n",
              "42812  Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEAs proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administrations efforts to reconsider marijuanas inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, its time to end this countrys failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSAs drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations, immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients access to medical marijuana. Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it wont give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or descheduling. Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuanas status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.Given the Biden Administrations repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Bidens campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use. Rescheduling marijuana is unscientific and harmful.

Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients access to medical marijuana. Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it wont give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or descheduling. Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuanas status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.Given the Biden Administrations repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Bidens campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.</td>\n",

              "      <td>This is long overdue and, in my opinion, does not go far enough in the rescheduling of cannabis (marijuana was coined as a racial slur). The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 and its subsequent prohibition had nothing to do with public health or smoking of the THC rich flower strains we associate with marijuana. It was purely a business lobbyists' ploy to eradicate hemp as it was the primary competition of the recently invented Nylon (rope), cotton (fabric), and wood pulp (paper). They lobbied the US Government, created a propaganda campaign, and the Big Lie was born. What many people don't realize is that up until then cannabis was such an important textile that farms were mandated to grow it.Its classification as a Schedule 1 narcotic under the Controlled Substance Act in 1970, advocated for by then President Richard Nixon (there's a trustworthy guy ;), was a political ploy to allow for the continued harassment and unwarranted incarceration of minorities following the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's. The US government then put pressure on the rest of the world to follow suit.The late, great Robin Williams said it perfectly; If the most dangerous thing about a 'drug' is getting caught with it, there's a real problem.Tens of millions of people and their families have been hurt due to their unfair incarceration for marijuana related offenses. In addition, countless innocent people have lost their lives as a result of the War on Drugs and its bolstering of gangs and cartels (by legalizing it the cartels have no business). Meanwhile the vast majority of the world has missed out on the many health benefits of cannabis-derived compounds and earth friendly hemp textiles.Today the Cannabis Industry is thriving in states where it has been legalized and thousands of businesses, who pay more than their fair share of federal, state, and local taxes, are employing hundreds of thousands of people while providing state tested, safe cannabis products. However, these businesses do not have the same tax deductions that other businesses are entitled to. Also, they do not have access to traditional financial services, such as banking and credit card transactions, and therefore are the target of criminals due to the cash nature of its commerce.We have let our governments brain wash us for too long. Lets be done.</td>\n",

By descheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup pollsupport cannabis legalization. But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health  Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someones ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. The criminalization of cannabisa legacy of the War on Drugswas a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. Its time to abandon this draconian approach.

So many upsides and less people in jail. An overall more productive society due to less criminal records. Less gets spent in jailing and more tax revenue from dispensaries. Its a win all around\",\n          \"Thanks for your attention to my comment on the DEAs proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administrations efforts to reconsider marijuanas inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, its time to end this countrys failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSAs drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations, immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients access to medical marijuana. Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it wont give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or descheduling. Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuanas status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.Given the Biden Administrations repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Bidens campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.\",\n          \"Housing is a human right, but too many people are denied access to this fundamental need because of their criminal record.I urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization.  In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup pollsupport cannabis legalization. The criminalization of cannabisa legacy of the War on Drugswas a policy decision rooted in racism. I support descheduling cannabis from the CSAa step toward righting the wrongs of its criminalization.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"textblob_sentiment_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.10973733522067257,\n        \"min\": -1.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8549,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.045728291316526615,\n          -0.01499999999999999,\n          -0.02559782518359068\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I support rescheduling.<br/><br/>It&#39;s been proven that people get heavily addicted to opiates and painkillers prescribed by their doctor. Several reports of individuals moving on to harder drugs such as heroin after their doctors cut off their prescription have been noted. People kill people over drugs such as this, but not marijuana. No one goes into life threatening withdrawal if they aren&#39;t able to get marijuana. No one goes out and kills someone to get a hit of marijuana. <br/><br/>Reschedule marijuana and work toward legalizing it. Use the tax revenue toward supporting our communities and properly educating our children about the true effects of drugs so they can be safe.   \n",
              "1      Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.<br/><br/>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. <br/><br/>The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use. <br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana is unscientific and harmful. I ask that you recognize the downfalls of this type of policy and keep marijuana as a Schedule I drug.   \n",

              "4      Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 and its subsequent prohibition had nothing to do with public health or smoking of the THC rich flower strains we associate with marijuana.  It was purely a business lobbyists&#39; ploy to eradicate hemp as it was the primary competition of the recently invented Nylon (rope), cotton (fabric), and wood pulp (paper).  They lobbied the US Government, created a propaganda campaign, and the Big Lie was born.  What many people don&#39;t realize is that up until then cannabis was such an important textile that farms were mandated to grow it.<br/>Its classification as a Schedule 1 narcotic under the Controlled Substance Act in 1970, advocated for by then President Richard Nixon (there&#39;s a trustworthy guy ;), was a political ploy to allow for the continued harassment and unwarranted incarceration of minorities following the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960&#39;s.  The US government then put pressure on the rest of the world to follow suit.<br/>The late, great Robin Williams said it perfectly; &quot;If the most dangerous thing about a &#39;drug&#39; is getting caught with it, there&#39;s a real problem.&quot;<br/>Tens of millions of people and their families have been hurt due to their unfair incarceration for marijuana related &lsquo;offenses&rsquo;.  In addition, countless innocent people have lost their lives as a result of the War on Drugs and its bolstering of gangs and cartels (by legalizing it the cartels have no business).  Meanwhile the vast majority of the world has missed out on the many health benefits of cannabis-derived compounds and earth friendly hemp textiles.<br/>Today the Cannabis Industry is thriving in states where it has been legalized and thousands of businesses, who pay more than their fair share of federal, state, and local taxes, are employing hundreds of thousands of people while providing state tested, safe cannabis products.  However, these businesses do not have the same tax deductions that other businesses are entitled to.  Also, they do not have access to traditional financial services, such as banking and credit card transactions, and therefore are the target of criminals due to the cash nature of its commerce.<br/>We have let our governments brain wash us for too long.  Let&rsquo;s be done.   \n",
              "42809  Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

We have no such guidelines for measuring the amount of marijuana one can smoke/ingest and drive safely. Shouldn&#39;t we have those in place BEFORE we reschedule the classification of marijuana? <br/><br/>It does make sense that we work toward the legalization of marijuana, but so much needs to be put in place first, especially standards for safe driving.<br/><br/>My cousin was killed by a driver who was stoned. Please consider this.   \n",

In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.&mdash;70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll&mdash;support cannabis legalization. <br/><br/>But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health &amp; Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone&rsquo;s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. <br/><br/>The criminalization of cannabis&mdash;a legacy of the War on Drugs&mdash;was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It&rsquo;s time to abandon this draconian approach. I support descheduling cannabis from the CSA&mdash;a step toward righting the wrongs of its criminalization.   \n",
              "42812  Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA&rsquo;s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&rsquo;s time to end this country&rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.<br/><br/>Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&rsquo; access to medical marijuana. <br/><br/>Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.<br/><br/>The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &ldquo;descheduling.&rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. <br/><br/>Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. <br/><br/>Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.<br/><br/>Given the Biden Administration&rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.   \n",

Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rescheduling marijuana is unscientific and harmful. I ask that you recognize the downfalls of this type of policy and keep marijuana as a Schedule I drug.</td>\n",

While I appreciate the Biden Administration&amp;rsquo;s efforts to reconsider marijuana&amp;rsquo;s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it&amp;rsquo;s time to end this country&amp;rsquo;s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA&amp;rsquo;s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients&amp;rsquo; access to medical marijuana. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won&amp;rsquo;t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or &amp;ldquo;descheduling.&amp;rdquo; Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana&amp;rsquo;s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the Biden Administration&amp;rsquo;s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden&amp;rsquo;s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA.

              "      <td>This is long overdue and, in my opinion, does not go far enough in the rescheduling of cannabis (marijuana was coined as a racial slur).  The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 and its subsequent prohibition had nothing to do with public health or smoking of the THC rich flower strains we associate with marijuana.  It was purely a business lobbyists&amp;#39; ploy to eradicate hemp as it was the primary competition of the recently invented Nylon (rope), cotton (fabric), and wood pulp (paper).  They lobbied the US Government, created a propaganda campaign, and the Big Lie was born.  What many people don&amp;#39;t realize is that up until then cannabis was such an important textile that farms were mandated to grow it.&lt;br/&gt;Its classification as a Schedule 1 narcotic under the Controlled Substance Act in 1970, advocated for by then President Richard Nixon (there&amp;#39;s a trustworthy guy ;), was a political ploy to allow for the continued harassment and unwarranted incarceration of minorities following the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960&amp;#39;s.  The US government then put pressure on the rest of the world to follow suit.&lt;br/&gt;The late, great Robin Williams said it perfectly; &amp;quot;If the most dangerous thing about a &amp;#39;drug&amp;#39; is getting caught with it, there&amp;#39;s a real problem.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Tens of millions of people and their families have been hurt due to their unfair incarceration for marijuana related &amp;lsquo;offenses&amp;rsquo;.  In addition, countless innocent people have lost their lives as a result of the War on Drugs and its bolstering of gangs and cartels (by legalizing it the cartels have no business).  Meanwhile the vast majority of the world has missed out on the many health benefits of cannabis-derived compounds and earth friendly hemp textiles.&lt;br/&gt;Today the Cannabis Industry is thriving in states where it has been legalized and thousands of businesses, who pay more than their fair share of federal, state, and local taxes, are employing hundreds of thousands of people while providing state tested, safe cannabis products.  However, these businesses do not have the same tax deductions that other businesses are entitled to.  Also, they do not have access to traditional financial services, such as banking and credit card transactions, and therefore are the target of criminals due to the cash nature of its commerce.&lt;br/&gt;We have let our governments brain wash us for too long.

In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.&amp;mdash;70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll&amp;mdash;support cannabis legalization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone&amp;rsquo;s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The criminalization of cannabis&amp;mdash;a legacy of the War on Drugs&amp;mdash;was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It&amp;rsquo;s time to abandon this draconian approach.

In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.&mdash;70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll&mdash;support cannabis legalization. <br/><br/>But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health &amp; Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone&rsquo;s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. <br/><br/>The criminalization of cannabis&mdash;a legacy of the War on Drugs&mdash;was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It&rsquo;s time to abandon this draconian approach. I support descheduling cannabis from the CSA&mdash;a step toward righting the wrongs of its criminalization.<br/><br/>Tobacco and alcohol are both more addictive and cause more harm to individuals and society than cannabis.
