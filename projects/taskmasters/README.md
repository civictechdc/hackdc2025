# Data Quality & Derived Layers

**Challenge:** Data Quality & Derived Layers

## üéØ Problem Statement

Extracting data from different types of documents such as PDFs, images and documents, while implementing keyword extraction on comments to improve data quality and accessibility in public comment datasets.

## üí° Solution

By extracting data from a wide variety of document formats including PDFs, images, and text documents our project ensures that valuable information contained in unstructured or hard to access files becomes accessible and analyzable. This directly addresses the challenge of inconsistent and fragmented data quality found in public comment datasets.

Additionally, by implementing keyword extraction on comments, we enable the identification of major themes, trends, and important topics within large volumes of public feedback. This approach transforms raw, unorganized data into structured, meaningful insights, helping stakeholders quickly understand public sentiment and key issues relevant to proposed rules or policies.

We are also converting JSON files to parquet format using AWS S3, Glue, and Athena services, which results in faster querying and improved data processing efficiency.
