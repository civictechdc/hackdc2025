# CMS Docket Assistant

**Team:** LLM.gov  
**Hackathon:** Civic Hack DC 2025  
**Challenge:** Data Accessibility / Usability for Non-Technical Stakeholders

CMS Docket Assistant is an LLM wrapper that utilizes RAG queries to answer general questions about dockets, making complex regulatory information accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

## üí° Solution

**Data Accessibility**
Transforms complex JSON text into machine-readable vector embeddings stored in S3. This enables semantic search, allowing machines to understand and quickly retrieve relevant data based on meaning, not just keywords.

**Usability for Non-Technical Stakeholders**
Provides a simple chat interface powered by an LLM. This allows non-technical users to easily ask questions in natural language and receive summarized information about dockets and comments, eliminating the need for technical skills.
