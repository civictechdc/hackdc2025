## 💡 Solution

A command-line tool written in Go that parses text from PDF files and outputs it to standard output or structured formats including CSV, JSON, and Parquet. The tool uses the `pdftotext` command-line utility from poppler-utils to extract text content from PDF documents, then converts it into the specified output format for better accessibility and analysis of regulatory documents.
