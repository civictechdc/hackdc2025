Dental providers should be included as a vital member of the health care team, particularly because dental access can be harder to work through than physical health providers. <br/>2. CMS should work with EHR or EDR software companies to include live link directory access in these systems, especially considering most emergency dental visits either refer patients back to their PCP or include a blanket statement to follow up with a dentist. An actual referral would be a more effective intervention to ensure appropriate continuity of care. <br/>3. Individual providers are important, but the designation of entire facilities such as FQHCs and RHCs should be identified and included.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551fe6d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:07:33Z", "organization": "PA Coalition for Oral Health", "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbc-pvk5-0z97", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0557/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0557/attachments"}}}}}
