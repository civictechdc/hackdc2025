I am in favor of this goal.<br/><br/>However, to provide accurate information, a provider&rsquo;s sex is an important factor. Many women  and adolescents are in need of procuring services from doctors of the same sex that they are. This is especially important for victims of sexual trauma.<br/><br/>It is noted that the directory intends to provide information &ldquo;including the provider&#39;s name, location, phone number, gender, specialty (taxonomy), practice address, and other identifiers for public use&rdquo;. Considering the recent use of the term &ldquo;gender&rdquo;, i.e. meaning how a person &ldquo;identifies&rdquo; vis-&agrave;-vis sex roles, etc., &ldquo;gender&rdquo; would not be useful information for most people. The &ldquo;sex&rdquo; (i.e. male or female) is instead important  and needed information.<br/><br/>I personally look for doctors that are the same sex as myself for comfort. I have had bad experiences with opposite sex doctors in the area of gynecology and childbirth, and have had the need to find a same sex physicians for this speciality.<br/><br/>The actual sex of a healthcare provider is critically important to many patients, particularly to women seeking gynecologic, obstetric, or any other care. None of the proposed classification definitions of gender/sex guarantees a patient will see a provider of the sex she or he chooses.<br/><br/>If the need to provide &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo; information is deemed important, this can be included also, but should not replace information on a provider&rsquo;s sex category. Otherwise, the directory will not meet the intended goals, and will become a useless politically motivated exercise.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.<br/>", "country": "United States", "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Lisa", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551c6d6", "lastName": "Compton", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:05:30Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-05T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": "NY", "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbb-gwe8-0zrd", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0426/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0426/attachments"}}}}}
