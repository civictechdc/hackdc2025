Further, they have a right to select providers based on the sex of said providers.  There are many reasons why this right must be protected, but for the purposes of this feedback, I will list two examples. <br/><br/>Example 1.) A woman who has been raped or assaulted by a male perpetrator understandably may only choose to be examined by a female provider. <br/><br/>Example 2.) A woman or a man who is a member of a religious faith (say a Muslim woman or man) may also understandably choose to only be examined by a female or male provider depending on the tenants of their faith. <br/><br/>Attempts to obfuscate or change the definition of &quot;sex&quot; to include any aspect of Gender Ideology, directly undermine this basic patient right. Well-established definitions for sex that are based exclusively on biological, objective reality (as bequeathed to us by billions of years of mammalian evolution, and as observed by centuries of careful scientific study) must be maintained. <br/><br/>From Webster&#39;s Unabridged Dictionary:<br/><br/>The definition of Female is &quot;designating or of the sex that produces ova and bears offspring; opposed to male.&quot;<br/>The definition of Woman is &quot;an adult female human being&quot;<br/><br/>The definition for Male is &quot;designating or of the sex that fertilizes the ovum and begets offspring; opposed to female.&quot; <br/>The definition for Man is &quot;an adult male human being&quot;  <br/><br/>In closing, undermining this basic patient right will lead to disastrous health outcomes and harm for many, as they will delay critical health exams due to concerns that knowledge of the sex of their providers is not guaranteed. All medical providers have an ethical responsibility to abide by the Hippocratic Oath of &quot;do no harm&quot;.   <br/> ", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Allie", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006485517ce4", "lastName": "Snyder", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-06T14:51:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-04T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lb9-xdmq-z79v", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0248/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0248/attachments"}}}}}
