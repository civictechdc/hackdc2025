A person&#39;s sex does not and cannot change during their lifetime. &quot;Gender&quot; is a separate term that is irrelevant to the biological sex of a person&#39;s body, and should never supersede the reality of one&#39;s sex in records of any kind, especially medical records. <br/><br/>If patients&#39; sex are not recorded accurately, and people can retroactively change their records to pretend that they are and have always been the opposite sex, this will completely upend the accuracy of medical statistics, studies, and irreparably damage healthcare for women and men, who have different biologically-based healthcare needs.<br/><br/>Patients have the right to request care from a provider of their chosen sex, and if biological sex is no longer accurately or reliably recorded this is no longer possible. Women in particular are vulnerable to harm from men, biological males, and when seeking gynecologic, obstetric, or any other healthcare, should be able to expect with 100% certainty their provider&#39;s stated sex is their actual biological sex.<br/><br/>If you ignore the biologically accurate sex of patients and providers, everyone loses, but ultimately it is women who will be harmed the most. You will dissolve the hard fought sex-based human rights of women if you allow anything but the physical, chromosomal sex of a person to be on record. <br/><br/>Please, CMS, reject this proposal.", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Anonymous", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551bf96", "lastName": "Anonymous", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:05:37Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-05T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbb-k6sr-i9i8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0433/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0433/attachments"}}}}}
