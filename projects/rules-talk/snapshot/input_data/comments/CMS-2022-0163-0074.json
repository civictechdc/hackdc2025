I practice medicine, and deliver expert care to my patients. <br/><br/>The term &quot;provider&quot; obfuscates the level of training and expertise of the person rendering treatment; it confuses patients. Indeed, non-physician caregivers often want to be thought of as physicians by patients, and do not dissuade patients of the belief that they are being cared for by a physician, when they are not. <br/><br/>Labelling everyone as a &quot;provider&quot;makes all healthcare professionals appear equivalent. They are not.<br/><br/>It is best to refer to all health care professionals by their actual credentials, to accurately reflect training and degrees, and avoid confusion.<br/><br/>Physicians need their own directory, as they are a singularly distinct category of healthcare professional, and should be leading healthcare.&quot;", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Ramin", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648550521b", "lastName": "Rafie", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-02T14:08:39Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-11-28T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lb1-0taf-zof8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0074/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0074/attachments"}}}}}
