If I am injured, and especially if I have suffered injury from a male, I should have the right to be attended to by female practitioners. To forbid this is a horrendous injustice. <br/><br/>There are only two sexes, as sad and injust as that may feel to some or many. Please recognize that basic scientific fact, which informs so many millions of  women&#39;s, and men&#39;s, lives and health.<br/><br/>Please pay attention to the WDI Declaration on Women&rsquo;s Sex-Based Rights, which re-affirms women and girls&#39; sex-based rights as enumerated in the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and subsequent international agreements, and challenges the discrimination we experience from the replacement of the category of sex with that of &lsquo;gender identity&rsquo;. <br/><br/>The Declaration is a clear call to law and policy makers to retain the sex-based biological definition of woman.
