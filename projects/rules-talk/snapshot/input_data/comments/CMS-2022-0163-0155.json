None of the proposed classification definitions of gender/sex guarantees a patient will see a provider of the sex she or he chooses.<br/><br/>At a minimum, the Directory has a duty to provide clear information about the biological sex of patients and providers, unobscured by gender identity ideology. Ideally, the unverifiable and medically irrelevant notion of &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo; should be completely removed from the Directory.<br/><br/>I am writing to urge CMS to reject this proposal. Patients have the right to clear and accurate knowledge about the sex of their chosen providers.", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Anonymous", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006485516384", "lastName": "Anonymous", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-06T14:50:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-04T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lb9-m1eg-3waq", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0155/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0155/attachments"}}}}}
