Knowing someone&#39;s chosen gender is meaningless information. We need to stop conflating gender and sex.  Knowing a providers sex is absolutely necessary to some of us.  I have PTSD from sexual abuse. I do NOT want a male touching my body unless it is an absolute emergency or unless there is disclosure of sex (not gender) and necessity for a male doctor to be in attendance.  Any female should have the right to know the sex of her provider because most of us suffer some kind of abuse from males. Are there nice guys in this world?  Yes, of course.  But even those nice guys can&#39;t necessarily control their sexual impulses, and it&#39;s disgusting to think of any male &quot;getting off&quot; or &quot;getting it up&quot; by seeing or touching a female body. My body - my right to know who is seeing it and/or touching it!!!! Somebody else&#39;s right to hide out in an assumed gender should not trump my right to protect my own body!!!!!
