I,as well as everyone else, have the right to know the birth sex of healthcare providers that I entrust my body with. I vehemently oppose the concealment of the birth sex of healthcare providers. I also have children and they have the same right to know the true identity of their healthcare providers. Birth sex is a fundamental element of one&#39;s true identity. Any concealment of a healthcare provider&#39;s birth sex overrides the patient&#39;s right to informed consent, and actions taken by the healthcare provider under false pretenses is tantamount to sexual assault and malfeasance.
