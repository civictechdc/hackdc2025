It has medical as well as psychological and social implications. Women, in particular, need to know who the men are. Many women suffer from male violence. Many women experience discomfort, loss of dignity and fear when being treated in intimate settings by men. Some religions bar women from being treated by men.<br/><br/>The sex of a healthcare provider is critically important to many patients, particularly to women seeking gynecologic, obstetric, or any other care. None of the proposed classification definitions of gender/sex guarantees a patient will see a provider of the sex she or he chooses.<br/><br/>This is very personal to me. My dear mother-in-law is suffering from Parkinson&#39;s and dementia. Not only is she a lesbian who is uncomfortable around men, she was also sexually assaulted by a male doctor when she was a teenager. Now, with her diminished mental capacities, she is even more fearful of male providers of intimate care, which is why we always request female doctors, nurses and care attendants. Despite her dementia, she is acutely aware of the sex of her provider (as are most humans). A male with a gender identity of transwoman, transgendered or non-binary is still a man in her eyes. We do not consent on her behalf to be gaslight that a subjective feeling in a man&#39;s mind makes him a woman. Patients have a right to know the sex of their provider.", "country": "United States", "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Michelle", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006485519153", "lastName": "Krueger", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-06T14:52:35Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-05T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": "MN", "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lba-dmtf-4ei8", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0296/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0296/attachments"}}}}}
