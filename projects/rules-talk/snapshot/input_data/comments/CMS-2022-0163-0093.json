We also appreciated that the benefits discussions identified the various use cases and where this directory will be critically important. We fully support a Centralized Managed Directory given that the Directory is accurate, does not increase burden, and is governed by a multidisciplinary stakeholder committee under CMS. We believe these characteristics will drive adoption of the Directory.<br/>1. New Directory should be single source of truth<br/>a. This Directory will eventually be the &ldquo;Source of Truth&rdquo; for all Healthcare Use Cases and therefore, all constituents will have access related to their required use cases.<br/>b. Constituents must have the ability to electronically upload and download entries and changes from EHRs, and other HIT systems used by constituents, to and from the Directory<br/>c. EHRs must have standardized forms and capabilities to ease burden of data entry/revisions<br/>d. Data entered should be an incrementally evolving set based on use cases, with more data required with each use case<br/>i. Suggest the first use case be billing and insurance then<br/>ii. Clinical role-based provider information<br/>iii. Provider Information required for clinical referrals<br/>iv. Patient finding clinicians for care<br/>e. Data must be validated and there must be incentives and disincentives for accuracy.<br/>i. Accuracy is absolutely required. Recommend significant incentives as the primary motivation with eventual disincentives to ensure accuracy.<br/>2. Directory Governance<br/>a. Resides under CMS<br/>i. Multidisciplinary Governance Committee representing all constituents, e.g., Clinicians, Payors, HIT professionals, EHR vendors, Interoperability Networks, patients, etc.<br/>b. The Directory must have a Point of Contact and have a &ldquo;Help Desk&rdquo;.", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648550b72c", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-02T14:08:55Z", "organization": "MedAllies Network Council", "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-11-30T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lb4-070p-tn0n", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [{"id": "090000648550b72d", "type": "attachments"}], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0093/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0093/attachments"}}}}, "included": [{"id": "090000648550b72d", "type": "attachments", "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/attachments/090000648550b72d"}, "attributes": {"agencyNote": null, "authors": null, "docAbstract": null, "docOrder": 1, "fileFormats": [{"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2022-0163-0093/attachment_1.pdf", "format": "pdf", "size": 98139}], "modifyDate": "2022-11-30T14:00:45Z", "publication": null, "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "title": "COMMENTS RFI Federal Registry for council vote 11.30.22"}}]}
