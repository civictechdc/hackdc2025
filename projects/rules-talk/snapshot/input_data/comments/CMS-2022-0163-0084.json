Crucially, improvements in incentives, user experience, and federation are needed to unlock the full potential of NPPES.<br/><br/>Overview. We propose that rather than developing a new centralized directory, enhanced NPPES listings could serve as a &quot;primary key&quot; for healthcare directory information, maintaining the unique id used to tie together data from multiple organizations and storing links to flat files in FHIR format with additional, frequently-updated, information maintained by payor and provider organizations (e.g., details about services, hours, plan participation, and facilities). The term &quot;API&quot; sometimes refers to fine-grained interfaces (e.g., supporting queries like &quot;at which locations does Dr. Smith practice,&quot; or &quot;What time is Dr. Smith&#39;s clinic open next Tuesday&quot;), but we believe a simpler API might be a better starting point -- beginning with the ability to host a set of &quot;flat files&quot; at a well-known URL. Hosting flat files that are updated on a frequent basis would satisfy many consumption use cases. Leveraging SMART/HL7 FHIR Bulk Data standards would take advantage of tools and infrastructure designed for working with FHIR data. Third-party aggregators could use the data in NPPES and the referenced flat files to create applications targeted at specific use cases (e.g., a user-friendly, patient-facing application for people to find new healthcare providers).<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006485508519", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-02T14:08:47Z", "organization": "SMART Health IT", "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-02T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-11-29T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lb2-ainc-cecq", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [{"id": "090000648550851a", "type": "attachments"}], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0084/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0084/attachments"}}}}, "included": [{"id": "090000648550851a", "type": "attachments", "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/attachments/090000648550851a"}, "attributes": {"agencyNote": null, "authors": null, "docAbstract": null, "docOrder": 1, "fileFormats": [{"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2022-0163-0084/attachment_1.docx", "format": "docx", "size": 21580}, {"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2022-0163-0084/attachment_1.pdf", "format": "pdf", "size": 65372}], "modifyDate": "2022-11-29T09:14:12Z", "publication": null, "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "title": "CMS RFI Comments - SMART"}}]}
