Physicians across the U.S. are facing excessive workloads and crisis levels of work-related burnout that threaten the fabric of our healthcare system.<br/><br/>Further, a growing physician shortage presents increasing demands on medical professionals and barriers to equitable patient care. In fact, the Association of American Medical Colleges estimates the U.S. could see a shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034. <br/><br/>We founded Doximity in 2010 with a mission to connect and empower physicians, and to bring medical communication into the internet age. Our members, which today comprise over 80% of U.S. physicians, have shown us the importance of giving doctors a voice in innovation, and the power of physician-maintained, authentic, centralized information that highlights the unique training and clinical expertise that differentiate medical professionals.<br/><br/>We welcome physician-centric and technology-forward approaches to NDH design. Technologies that reduce administrative burden and eliminate redundancies are critical to addressing burnout and prioritizing patient care. This effort presents an opportunity to improve navigation and better serve communities across the country more efficiently, effectively and equitably.<br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551fd5d", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:07:20Z", "organization": "Doximity", "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbc-p6xe-4l60", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0543/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0543/attachments"}}}}}
