The Declaration is a clear call to law and policy makers to retain the sex-based biological definition of woman.<br/>My sex was determined at conception, a biological fact. I am a woman, daughter, sister, wife, mother. Only a female can claim those words. Gender means what exactly? It&rsquo;s not a biological reality, it is a man made social construct to highlight male supremacy and restrict female participation in the world. Please respect woman, women&rsquo;s bodies and our hard won rights. <br/>Who gains by eliminating a woman&rsquo;s right to female health providers? Who gains from eliminating women only hospital wards?  If the long term goal is to discourage the female sex from seeking medical treatment then carry on.
