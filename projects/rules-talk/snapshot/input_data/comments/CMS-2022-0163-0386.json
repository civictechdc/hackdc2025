When individual disciplines of licensure take a siloed approach to lobbying for changes in Telehealth and credentialing, it fractures the movement and stagnates progression to the detriment of patients. This type of movement needs to exist for all credentialed mental health disciplines in order to truly change access to care. For example, there is a Telehealth licensing pact in every disciplines, ie doctors, psychologists, CRNPs and if all came together under one singular database, access would greatly expand. <br/><br/>We outline two use cases:<br/><br/>Patients can have access to more providers- we have kids who we treat in high school and when they go to college we can&rsquo;t see them anymore. They need that therapeutic relationship to navigate them through an integral time of transition, but they cannot receive the care they need.  <br/><br/>If a provider is only licensed in one state and they move out of state, it can take them up to a year to reestablish licensure and credentialing for that state. We loose the provider&#39;s capacity to see patients in both the state they move to as well as their previous state. <br/><br/>Knowing what providers are credentialed where, and more importantly how they can be credentialed in certain states who abide by telehealth pacts will decrease the burden on providers expanding their geography and assist patients in continuity of care throughout their journey regardless of physical location.
