Perhaps creating a separate database for physicians to avoid confusion between physicians and non-physicians. Additionally, physicians are not &quot;providers&quot; and they do not have &quot;consumers&quot;. Physicians are trained in the art of medicine and provide medical care to patients in a sacred partnership. Referring to patients as consumers perpetuates the undertones of disgusting for-profit motives in healthcare.
