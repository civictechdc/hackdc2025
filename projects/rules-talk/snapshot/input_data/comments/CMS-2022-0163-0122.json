Currently, we are only getting a clinic name and their FHIR URL. (Try finding the location of &quot;ABC Pediatrics&quot; or &quot;Cardiology Consultants&quot; without an address. We can&#39;t help a consumer download their data via the FHIR API if we don&#39;t know which specific clinic the URL is referencing. <br/>1) We need the clinic&#39;s full address (including suite number) associated with a name/FHIR endpoint URL. <br/>2) We need a list of names and full addresses that are also associated with a single FHIR endpoint URL<br/>3) We need the developer portal URL (especially for clinics who require a unique client ID and secret)<br/>4) a logo would be nice too<br/><br/>It seems reasonable to require the EHR vendor to supply this information. They have this information already and are required to list the URLs. Adding the few other pieces of information should not be difficult for them (and may be difficult for provider organizations to understand where to get their FHIR URL).", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006485513969", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-06T14:50:06Z", "organization": "PatientLink/MyLinks", "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-02T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lb7-0usm-kwkp", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0122/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0122/attachments"}}}}}
