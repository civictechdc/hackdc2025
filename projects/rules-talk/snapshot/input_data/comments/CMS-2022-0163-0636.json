The most underserved and less abled stakeholders in health often find the fees and costs of solutions built around FHIR API to be a barrier to access. Inclusion of CSV will allow the possibility that forms of NDH access can emerge that are more functionally &quot;open&quot; to practical access to those who need and seek care, but lack sufficient standing or resources.<br/><br/>Thank you for your compassion and consideration!", "country": "United States", "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "John", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551fa22", "lastName": "Odden", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-09T13:02:52Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": "CA", "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbc-m909-jn2f", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0636/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0636/attachments"}}}}}
