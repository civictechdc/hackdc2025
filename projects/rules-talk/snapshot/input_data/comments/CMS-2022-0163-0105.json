Hospitals and their administrative staff are already overwhelmed and understaffed. CMS could help bolster participation by creating an API that could be used/purchased/ that would allow easy upload of staff directories into the platform being created. As an incentive for participation hospitals and health systems could receive a one-time grant to continue to maintain accurate directories or purchase software that would help maintain current staff directories. Then, quarterly CMS could offer a nominal medicare reimbursement bonus as part of interoperability compliance to all who have maintained accurate staff directories.
