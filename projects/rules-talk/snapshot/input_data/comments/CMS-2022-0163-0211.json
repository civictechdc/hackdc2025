A patient&rsquo;s sex is also a crucial fact if a patient is to receive appropriate medical care. However, providers and patients are currently identified only by the term &ldquo;Administrative Gender&rdquo; which is defined as, &ldquo;The gender of a person used for administrative [recordkeeping] purposes.&rdquo; This does not indicate the provider&rsquo;s sex.<br/><br/>The documentation for this CMS Directory proposal states that &ldquo;there are many considerations around sex and gender documentation&rdquo; and that &ldquo;various social and biological attributes&rdquo; are relevant, so that, &ldquo;[i]n addition to this administrative gender, other kinds of gender or sex properties may be represented.&rdquo; Five other ways to represent a patient&rsquo;s gender and sex are described. It appears these will also be used to describe the gender and/or sex of healthcare providers in the proposed Provider Directory. Here is a summary of the five proposed additional representations:<br/><br/>Clinical Sex &ndash; a testable observation about a biological property. There are several different<br/>types of clinical sex, including karyotypic/genetic/chromosomal, gonadal, ductal, phenotypic,<br/>etc.<br/>Clinical Gender &ndash; an observation about the patient.<br/>Gender Identity &ndash; an indication from the patient about what gender he or she claims to be.<br/>Sex assigned at Birth &ndash; the sex assigned at birth, as documented on the birth registration.<br/>Legal Sex &ndash; The legal sex of a patient can vary from region to region and country to country. A<br/>single patient may have multiple legal sex values at the same time in different jurisdictions.<br/><br/>The actual sex of a healthcare provider is critically important to many patients, particularly to women seeking gynecologic, obstetric, or any other care. None of the proposed classification definitions of gender/sex guarantees a patient will see a provider of the sex she or he chooses.<br/><br/>Any schemata or classification of healthcare providers must make it clear to patients what the objectively verifiable, genetic/chromosomal sex is of every provider. This is what virtually every human being on earth understands to be sex (as opposed to &ldquo;gender&rdquo;), and patients have the right to know this about providers they choose for healthcare. To deny patients this information begins the doctor/provider-patient relationship &ndash; which should be one of profound trust and care &ndash; with a deception. Additionally, it opens a path for the charge of assault, based on lack of consent, if a patient is assigned a provider of the sex the patient would not have chosen had the relevant information been made available.<br/><br/>At a minimum, the Directory has a duty to provide clear information about the biological sex of patients and providers, unobscured by gender identity ideology. Ideally, the unverifiable and medically irrelevant notion of &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo; should be completely removed from the Directory.<br/><br/>I am writing to urge CMS to reject this proposal. Patients have the right to clear and accurate knowledge about the sex of their chosen providers.", "country": "United States", "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Aurora", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006485517305", "lastName": "Cobb", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-06T14:51:24Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-04T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": "ME", "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lb9-qxi3-653l", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0211/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0211/attachments"}}}}}
