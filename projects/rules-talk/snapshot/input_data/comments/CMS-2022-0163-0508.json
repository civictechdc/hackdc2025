APG recommends that the agency allow an opportunity for all parties to contribute and review information included in the NDH while designating a single &ldquo;source of truth&rdquo; for sorting out any inconsistencies in the information added for each provider.  Although APG recognizes that the NDH, once introduced, will be improved over time based on lessons learned once, APG encourages CMS to expedite this review process as much as possible so that health plans and other provider directory hosts can transition from maintaining dual efforts to relying solely on the NDH.
