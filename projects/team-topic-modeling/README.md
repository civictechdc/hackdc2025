# Summary of Regulated Topics, Keywords, and Visualization Insights

**Team:** Team Topic Modeling  
**Hackathon:** Civic Hack DC 2025  
**Challenge:** Topic & Sentiment Analysis

## üéØ Problem Statement

Automated analysis of regulatory documents to identify topics that are regulated and extract meaningful keywords that describe regulations. The goal is to process legal documents and policy submissions to uncover regulatory focus areas and language trends.

**Description:**
Check out the full [project readme](./upstream/README.md) for more details.

## üí° Solution

The project processes regulatory documents through an NLP pipeline:

1. **Regulatory Sentence Extraction**: Identifies sentences containing regulatory language using keywords like "shall", "must", "prohibited", "required", "mandated"
2. **Topic & Keyword Extraction**: Uses spaCy for topic identification through noun chunks and RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) for keyword extraction
3. **Data Cleaning**: Filters out vague topics and stop words to focus on meaningful regulatory content
4. **Visualization**: Generates bar charts showing keyword counts per topic and word clouds for each regulatory topic
5. **Structured Output**: Converts results to pandas DataFrames for analysis and export

The system analyzes public comments, legal documents, and policy submissions to identify regulatory focus areas and language patterns.
