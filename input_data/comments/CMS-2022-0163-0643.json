We are connected through a series of network hubs in which information can be exchanged back and forth so why haven&rsquo;t we done something like that for healthcare? A centralized data hub would work great for healthcare and would aid in many parts that are lacking reinforcement in the healthcare system. Patient healthcare centralized into one data hub would facilitate sharing patient data hub in a cloud-based data platform, it would also help in keeping track of Medicare or healthcare plans or payment options, in addition, it would allow for better tracking of medication that is prescribed.<br/>A healthcare data hub that enables patient sharing, through a set of strict standards and guidelines, enables providers, pharmacies, and any other type of healthcare facility or provider. It would allow the user to be able to share and verify their health history. For being a developed country we are behind in initiating a project that will enable centralization and shared information examples of developed countries with health data hubs are France and Germany. Telehealth would be one branch that would benefit from having a centralized healthcare hub since telehealth is all about doing things virtually. With an increase in people obtaining medication through the internet, it would be ideal for the person prescribing the medication to have at least a deeper understanding of the patient&rsquo;s medical history. In addition, in times of emergencies when a patient may have suffered an accident and is unconscious and unable to advocate for themselves in terms of their medical history or allergies. Having a central healthcare hub would allow the nurses and doctors in the emergency room to go through this person&rsquo;s medical information and find out whether the emergency room treatment is the right one for this patient. <br/>Medicare is complicated especially when it comes to choosing benefits for C and D. It would be helpful to have all this information in a central healthcare hub where the patient and the pharmacists can view the medical insurance options. It would also allow patients to obtain telehealth help faster and less costly than in-visit service. If the patient has a rash, it would be easy to request aid from a doctor virtually and have the doctor prescribe medication for that rash, or with the doctor being able to view the medical history of the patient then he would be able to notice that this patient has had chickenpox before and based on the age and the way the &ldquo;rash&rdquo; appears then the patient is suffering from shingles. Avoiding the costly fee of in-office visits would and aiding the shortage of nurses in certain regions would be a good reasons to incorporate a centralized data hub.<br/>A better way to keep track of medication that gets prescribed. Might be the best way to do a type of contact tracing of how often medication gets prescribed, and who picks it up. Might help solve the issue of prescription drug abuse. Prescription drug abuse has become a real problem in the United States, with 100,000 deaths due to drug abuse.3 Many things can be done to help solve the drug abuse in this country and one of them would be having a centralized healthcare hub. With a way to keep track of the amount and type of prescription drugs that are being administered, there would be greater control over substances that are being abused more than others and stricter rules can be implemented in order to prevent further abuse. There is also the option of obtaining a type of contact tracing for who is picking up the prescribed drugs. It may be possible to turn the problem of substance abuse into an epidemiological issue and be able to trace the epidemic of substance abuse by keeping track of information that can be saved and accessed through a central healthcare hub.<br/>", "country": "United States", "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Gabriela", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648552031f", "lastName": "Sanchez", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-09T13:02:57Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-09T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": "DC", "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbc-ugy7-oemh", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0643/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0643/attachments"}}}}}
