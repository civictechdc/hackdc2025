DSMT is shown to improve outcomes for people living with diabetes, yet it remains an underutilized service. Publishing the list of accredited or recognized DSMT programs will help make it easier for providers and beneficiaries to identify local programs. The CMS Quality Safety &amp; Oversight Group (QSOG)receives a monthly report of active and closed DSMT programs from the Association of Diabetes Care &amp; Education Specialists and the American Diabetes Association, the two Accrediting Organizations certified by CMS. The information is accessible and could be published in a National Health Provider Directory. <br/><br/>ADCES also urges CMS to include up-to-date information on CDC-recognized providers of diabetes prevention programs. Medicare beneficiaries could find out where in their area they could access recognized providers who facilitate the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP).  Medicaid beneficiaries could learn if CDC-recognized providers of the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) are available in their state and locality. CMS has its own list of CDC-recognized providers of MDPP and could easily get CDC&rsquo;s list of recognized providers in the National DPP.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of our comments. <br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551ff7e", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:07:46Z", "organization": "Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists", "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbc-qevd-wpck", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0570/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0570/attachments"}}}}}
