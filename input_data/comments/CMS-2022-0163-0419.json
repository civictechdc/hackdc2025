From a consumer perspective, having one that is updated and accurate so I can find medical treatment without the &quot;filter&quot; of those my insurance covers would be a huge step forward.  People need to find support and services, sometimes urgently, and a single location to find those resources would be very empowering to me.<br/><br/>On the flip side, I&#39;ve heard from various doctors and providers that they don&#39;t want their phone numbers and email addresses available to the general population, and will fight this.  But I ask, why practice medicine if you don&#39;t want people to call you and email you to see if you can help them?  <br/><br/>The key to success, from a consumer and patient perspective, in my opinion will be the accuracy of the information maintained in this directory.  Will it show correct phone numbers, new physician practices/provider settings, changes to existing practices/settings, and help a person connect with the professionals listed?  Ideally, someone like me would use DIRECT or another secure mechanism to send my medical records to the provider I&#39;m seeing so that my information is available to them even if interoperability across healthcare isn&#39;t robust.  That is what will be important to success from a patient/consumer perspective, which may not be the same priorities as the providers listed in the directory will have.", "country": "United States", "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Maria", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551c458", "lastName": "Moen", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:05:23Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-05T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": "TN", "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbb-ek5u-pr6l", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0419/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0419/attachments"}}}}}
