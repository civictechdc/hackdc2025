Sex pertains to the genes and anatomical characteristics that every person is born with. (A minimal number of people are born with ambiguous characteristics.) These anatomical characteristics are evolutionarily adapted to procreation. Women have uterus, ovaries, vagina, etc., which are features that allow them to internally carry and then deliver baby. Men have gonads, penis, and those tubes that allow them to impregnate women. This is settled before birth and cannot be changed.
