Clinical definitions are meaningless in this regard. What matters is how the patient perceives their provider. Someone&#39;s inner identity has no bearing on how they are perceived by others.  <br/><br/>In a healthcare setting, a patient not sharing critical details with their provider or walking out of an appointment because they feel uncomfortable that their perception does not line up with their expectation is a very negative outcome.<br/><br/>If I want a man as a provider, I want someone that is indistinguishable from a male. Apart from edge cases, the easiest way is to let the patient know if their provider is XX or XY. <br/><br/>This is especially true considering that the medicare provider directory is used by older Americans - A man/male or woman/female is simply what they perceive them to be, their identity does not matter. <br/><br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Kevin", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551bccc", "lastName": "Price", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:05:11Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-05T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": "KY", "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbb-bwxf-kj86", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0408/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0408/attachments"}}}}}
