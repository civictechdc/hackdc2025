APhA represents pharmacists in all practice settings, including community pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care facilities, specialty pharmacies, community health centers, physician offices, ambulatory clinics, managed care organizations, hospice settings, and government facilities. Our members strive to improve medication use, advance patient care, and enhance public health.<br/><br/>APhA generally supports the establishment of an NDH and the use of Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to enable data exchange. Specifically, under &ldquo;C. Comment Solicitation&rdquo; (FR 61026) in the RFI, CMS is soliciting comments on whether &ldquo;an NDH [should] include&hellip;suppliers, pharmacies [emphasis added], public health entities, community organizations, nursing facilities, suppliers of durable medical equipment or health information networks?&rdquo; APhA strongly recommends that both &ldquo;pharmacist(s),&rdquo; and &ldquo;pharmacies,&rdquo; be included in an NDH to meet CMS&rsquo; proposed intent to &ldquo;create a &lsquo;centralized data hub&rsquo; for directory and digital contact information containing the most accurate, up-to-date, and validated data&rdquo; (FR 61019) that has a potential benefit of being &ldquo;available not only to CMS, but also publicly available for other payers and developers to utilize in their own directories&rdquo; (FR 61023).
