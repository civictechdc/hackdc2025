The alternative ways &quot;to represent ... the gender and/or sex of patients and healthcare providers&quot; in the proposed new Provider Directory will only serve to further degrade patients&#39; confidence in and comfort with their doctors. There is no room, absolutely no room, for the woke nonsense that is pervading so much of bureaucratic Washington today.<br/><br/>What you refer to as &quot;Clinical Sex &ndash; a testable observation about a biological property. There are several different types of clinical sex, including karyotypic/genetic/chromosomal, gonadal, ductal, phenotypic, etc,&quot; is what has been known for thousands of years as the actual sex of an individual, not just for humans but for every vertebrate animal on the planet since before dinosaurs walked the earth. <br/><br/>In medicine, above all other endeavors, it is incumbent on us to be truthful, objective, and stick to scientifically demonstrable fact. All today&#39;s woke, alternative definitions of &quot;sex,&quot; &quot;gender,&quot; &quot;man,&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; have no place in the relationship of patients with their physicians.<br/><br/>The actual sex of a healthcare provider is critically important to many patients, particularly to women seeking gynecologic, obstetric, or any other care. None of the proposed classification definitions of gender/sex guarantees a patient will see a provider of the sex she or he chooses.
