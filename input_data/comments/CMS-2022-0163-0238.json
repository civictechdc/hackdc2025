Mental and psychological health depend on clear definitions of identity.  It is vital that the sex of the practitioner I am choosing is clear, not obscured by the need to go overboard to not offend trans people.  Women-born-women since birth have been oppressed as females.  Everyday life is a torture of female negation and abuse.  Just as the race of the doctor means everything, not just in confidence but the doctor&#39;s perceptions of the patient&#39;s complaints (Take Serena Williams&#39; maternity nightmare as an example)<br/>I want to know who I&#39;m getting as a doctor!
