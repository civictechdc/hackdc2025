The RFI seeks information and recommendations on creating a CMS-run centralized data hub that patients, providers and payers could use to navigate health plan networks and facilitate health information exchange to improve access and outcomes.<br/><br/>Premier shares CMS&rsquo; goals to improve access to provider information and facilitate health information exchange and data reporting. In our comments, Premier shares the experiences and concerns of our member hospitals, their employed physicians and independent physicians aligned with them. Specifically, Premier asks CMS to consider the following:<br/>&bull; Leverage federal authorities to streamline existing provider directory requirements, reducing duplication, provider and payer burden, and barriers to patient access to correct information;<br/>&bull; Consider the readiness of existing technology needed to support a centralized data hub, and invest in developing standards and incentivizing market development;<br/>&bull; Improve value to consumers by incorporating cost and quality data; and<br/>&bull; Utilize the NDH for centralized, federal-level provider credentialing and require CMS-regulated health plans to accept credentialing conducted by CMS.<br/><br/>Please see the attachment for more details on Premier&#39;s recommendations. Premier appreciates the opportunity to submit these comments on the request for information on the potential creation of a National Directory of Healthcare Providers and Services.
