If the federal Medicaid and Medicare program is contaminated with garbage language that disadvantages Women even more than we already are regarding healthcare there will be a glut of lawsuits costing the American people so I object to anything that deflects from the idea that Women are human and have sex based rights that we refuse to give up in order to shield perverted individuals claiming theirfeelings are more important than SCIENCE and Women and girls safety.
