My sex is crucial to the healthcare I seek and receive.<br/><br/>However, providers and patients are currently identified in the CMS Directory proposal only by the term &ldquo;Administrative Gender&rdquo; which is defined as, &ldquo;The gender of a person used for administrative [recordkeeping] purposes.&rdquo; This does not indicate the provider&rsquo;s actual sex.<br/><br/>The documentation for this CMS Directory proposal states that &ldquo;there are many considerations around sex and gender documentation&rdquo; and that &ldquo;various social and biological attributes&rdquo; are relevant, so that, &ldquo;in addition to this administrative gender, other kinds of gender or sex properties may be represented.&rdquo; <br/>Five other ways to represent a patient&rsquo;s gender and sex are described. <br/>1.  Clinical Sex &ndash; a testable observation about a biological property. There are several different<br/>types of clinical sex, including karyotypic/genetic/chromosomal, gonadal, ductal, phenotypic, etc<br/>2.  Clinical Gender &ndash; an observation about the patient.<br/>3.  Gender Identity &ndash; an indication from the patient about what gender he or she claims to be.<br/>4.  Sex assigned at Birth &ndash; the sex assigned at birth, as documented on the birth registration.<br/>5.  Legal Sex &ndash; The legal sex of a patient can vary from region to region and country to country. Which means a single patient may have multiple legal sex values at the same time in different jurisdictions.<br/>It appears these will also be used to describe the gender and/or sex of healthcare providers in the proposed Provider Directory.<br/><br/>I am female, mother of two sons, grandmother of two small boys.   The actual sex of my healthcare providers has always been critically important to me as a patient, especially with respect to the gynecological, obstetric and other medical care I have required over the course of my long female life.  Other women share my concerns.  But none of the proposed CMS classification definitions of gender/sex guarantee we will see a provider of the sex we choose.  <br/><br/>In the proposed classification of &ldquo;Clinical Sex&rdquo; a man who appears female after taking female hormones and cosmetic surgeries might be listed as a female provider to any patient seeking only women providers. The classification &ldquo;Sex assigned at Birth&rdquo; may be changed or falsified later in life on birth certificates. The proposed category of &ldquo;Legal Sex&rdquo; would create a process by which any person could attain legal status of the opposite biological sex.<br/><br/>Any classification of healthcare providers must make it clear to patients what the objectively verifiable, biological (genetic/chromosomal/gonadic/reproductive) sex is of every provider.  This is what I, and virtually every human being on earth, understands to be sex (as opposed to &ldquo;gender&rdquo;, which is based on cultural sex-based stereotypes.  Men are not and cannot actually change their biological sex to female.<br/><br/>Denied this information, our relationship with our healthcare providers begins with deception rather than trust and care, and opens a path to charges of assault if a patient is assigned a provider of the sex the patient would not have chosen had the relevant information been made available.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo; of medical professionals is irrelevant to me.  My sex is what I expect to be relevant to them when I receive treatment.  They are treating my female body, not cultural sex-stereotypes.<br/>I need to know the sex of the healthcare provider involved in my care, especially in my intimate care (gynecological or otherwise); my consent to care is dependent on that information.<br/>Which means, at a minimum, that the proposed Directory has a duty to provide clear information about the biological sex of patients and providers, unobscured by gender identity ideology. Ideally, the unverifiable and medically irrelevant notion of &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo; should be completely removed from the Directory.  <br/><br/>I am a signatory to the Declaration on Women&rsquo;s Sex-Based Rights, Article 1 of which states that organizations should &ldquo;understand that the inclusion of men who claim to have a female &lsquo;gender identity&rsquo; into the category of women in law, policies, and practice constitutes discrimination against women by impairing the recognition of women&rsquo;s sex-based human rights.&rdquo;<br/><br/>I write to urge CMS to reject the proposed changes to the Directory.<br/>Patients have the right to clear and accurate knowledge about the sex of their chosen providers.<br/><br/>Your truly, <br/>Leslie Sudock<br/>Philadelphia, PA<br/><br/>", "country": "United States", "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Leslie", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006485519b09", "lastName": "Sudock", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:03:54Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-05T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": "PA", "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lba-ucfe-3kh5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [{"id": "0900006485519b0a", "type": "attachments"}], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0326/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0326/attachments"}}}}, "included": [{"id": "0900006485519b0a", "type": "attachments", "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/attachments/0900006485519b0a"}, "attributes": {"agencyNote": null, "authors": null, "docAbstract": null, "docOrder": 1, "fileFormats": [{"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2022-0163-0326/attachment_1.docx", "format": "docx", "size": 18080}, {"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2022-0163-0326/attachment_1.pdf", "format": "pdf", "size": 39134}], "modifyDate": "2022-12-05T08:51:23Z", "publication": null, "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "title": "Sudock CMS Comment"}}]}
