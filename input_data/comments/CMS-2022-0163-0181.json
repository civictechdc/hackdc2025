I will turn 66 years old in a week. I am reluctant to seek medical care on any matter, because I will be in a state of distress if a nurse or doctor or any other practitioner is like my former husband, obviously dressing and applying make-up in such a way as to force others to identify him as female, when he is clearly a biological male. <br/><br/>I have not been for a Pap smear, a breast x-ray or blood tests because I do not have the capacity to relive the betrayals of my former husband, who is now the COO of a tech database company. He lied and committed fraud in court twice to cheat our 2 sons out of child support. I had to take this wealthy individual back to court to pay his half of the in-state college tuitions, which he refused to pay. <br/><br/>I do not trust the medical establishment in the US because they lie to teens and tell them they &quot;can change sex.&quot; <br/><br/>Do not change the wording to remove &quot;sex&quot; and replace it with &quot;gender&quot;. <br/><br/>For a further understanding of what women like me have been through, visit Lime Soda Films youtube channel and watch the trailer for the documentary, Behind the Looking Glass. <br/><br/>The overemphasis on plastic surgery to create a superficial &quot;opposite sex&quot; appearance has had many terrible ramifications for our society. There are many, many detransitioners, who are likely to end up going to the new death cult in Canada to end their lives. They regret the surgeries and the extreme health problms that wrong sex hormones and loss of bodily integrity have wrought on them.
