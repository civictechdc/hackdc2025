The rest can be custom built. <br/><br/>Similarly for maintaining provider directories, we should have a super simple way to a. identify the top impactful usecases: [provider, carrier, plans accepted]<br/>b. credentialed to practice in a state<br/>c. degree certificate etc <br/><br/>The top usecases should be insanely simple to accept by the provider and should work for 90% of the usecases. Often we make it all too complex for the majority in order to address the corner cases. <br/><br/>A. Carrier:<br/>1. Each insurance company provides a list of state specific plans that they support<br/><br/>B. Provider:<br/>[One time]<br/>1. Creates an account using id.me or something similar. Their account identifies the state. Remember very few practice in multiple states<br/>2. Uploads the credentials, degree etc. <br/>3. Provides the phone #/email that he/she uses<br/>[In-frequent]<br/>4. On account creation, he/she selects the insurance company, and the plans supported. <br/><br/>C. Consumer[Patient]<br/>As an end user, I can <br/>a. Select my doctor, and check if my plan is supported. <br/>b. If any change happens (like my plan is no longer supported or a new plan is accepted), I get a text/email message only if my plan is not supported  <br/><br/>On a regular basis, <br/>1. Everytime the insurance company adds/removes a plan(rare), the provider gets a text/email to which the provider accepts/denies being part of the plan. <br/>This can be sent to the provider 2x a week to avoid being a nuisance. <br/><br/>2. Everytime a provider decides to drop off/add into a plan, he/she logs in and selects it to add or remove the plan<br/><br/>3. Provider can also say here that they accept new patients or not. The subscribed patients get a notification<br/><br/>Distribution: give an incentive to create and spread<br/>1. Doctors get $500 if they create an account and update it. <br/>2. They can share with their colleagues and get $250 (They should have an incentive to spread the info). <br/>With one million providers =&gt; cost $750M<br/><br/>Misc:<br/>1. Anyone who finds the data wrong gets $25 paid by the provider/carrier who entered the wrong data. IF not $, they get a &quot;Thank you certificate&quot; - some form of recognition. No penalties over $100<br/>2. Make this data downloadable for use by the community. Do not charge. <br/>3. Allow a github community to build tools around it. Provide the key contributors excellent recognition. <br/><br/>Expand the above for provider systems(hospitals etc). They have an IT staff and can follow a similar approach<br/><br/>PS: I will be glad to build it at a low cost if one is really interested. Anyway that is not the intent! Key is that it needs to be simple<br/><br/>", "country": "United States", "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Anil", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064855206ab", "lastName": "Pillai", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:08:33Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": "CA", "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbd-3sq5-nj4i", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0622/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0622/attachments"}}}}}
