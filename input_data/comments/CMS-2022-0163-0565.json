Days later Nile displayed flu like symptoms, multiple physicians did not take his signs of sepsis seriously and Nile died on April 17th 2006 after waiting in the hospital for 15 hours before he received a single drop of a life saving antibiotic.  We work with The Patient Safety Action Network is a national coalition of individuals and organizations, consisting of patients who have been medically harmed, their loved ones, and concerned advocates. With a unified voice we focus solely on and with patients to raise awareness and to create accountability, transparency and safer health care.  We work in the areas of physician oversight and accountability, medical device safety, health care acquired infection prevention and other topics.
