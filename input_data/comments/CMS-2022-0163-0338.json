This past summer I discovered what I believe is structural racism in terms of how acupuncture and Chinese Medicine has been treated in the United States. I keep finding more and more documentation to support this. Acupuncture has been used in the United States since the 1700&#39;s by the Asian cultures that have been practicing this medicine for thousands of years. Now there are efforts to rebrand all of acupuncture and Chinese medicine and misbrand the acupuncture needle as a &quot;dry needle&#39; which has not gone through FDA regulations. <br/><br/>But what I have learned is that in Minnesota there is no definition for structural racism and therefore there are no legal definitions to argue that it is structural racism. <br/><br/>This is my definition.  &quot;A combination of public policies, institutional<br/>practices, social forces, ideologies, and processes that generate and perpetuate inequities among races.&quot; Those that are rebranding and mislabeling the acupuncture needle are doing so by belittling acupuncture and Chinese medicine and acting superior. I do not think that the professions that are doing this realize what they are doing. <br/><br/>So, if this becomes the legal definition in state and federal law than yes structural racism has been involved in what has happened to acupuncture and Chinese medicine. If not than it is my opinion based on this definition and no will care to do anything about it. <br/><br/>So, I do not want Licensed Acupuncturist from being excluded from a National Directory because of this. I do not want us from being excluded from being able to bill our full scope as historically in the US chiropractic, osteopathy, physical therapy and anesthesiology has roots from Chinese medicine. I want dry needling to be recognized as acupuncture and that we are included for billing. For 42 years there have been multiple bills before Congress to recognize acupuncturist and they have failed every time.  <br/><br/>Please do not let this be another example. Please take the time to review my documents. It isn&#39;t perfect because I am not a writer, and it is difficult to put into words what I have seen. <br/><br/>The term Acupuncturist first showed up in the 1800&#39;s yet it took until 2018 to get the Bureau of Labor and Statistics to recognize the profession. Why? Because the acupuncture technique was the practice of medicine and included in other professions that is what the request for comment in 2010 said and we were denied once again the establishment of a profession. https://www.newspapers.com/clip/110292682/acupuncturist/ <br/><br/>Thank you again for allowing this conversation. <br/><br/>Respectfully Submitted,<br/><br/>Bonnie Bolash, L.Ac.", "country": "United States", "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Bonnie", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551a1f8", "lastName": "Bolash", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:04:06Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-05T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": "MN", "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lba-wn8s-ptff", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [{"id": "090000648551a1f9", "type": "attachments"}, {"id": "090000648551a1fa", "type": "attachments"}, {"id": "090000648551a1fb", "type": "attachments"}, {"id": "090000648551a1fc", "type": "attachments"}], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0338/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0338/attachments"}}}}, "included": [{"id": "090000648551a1f9", "type": "attachments", "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/attachments/090000648551a1f9"}, "attributes": {"agencyNote": null, "authors": null, "docAbstract": null, "docOrder": 1, "fileFormats": [{"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2022-0163-0338/attachment_1.xlsx", "format": "xlsx", "size": 207059}], "modifyDate": "2022-12-05T09:55:47Z", "publication": null, "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "title": "Copy of 04 PE Spreadsheet-20560-20561"}}, {"id": "090000648551a1fa", "type": "attachments", "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/attachments/090000648551a1fa"}, "attributes": {"agencyNote": null, "authors": null, "docAbstract": null, "docOrder": 2, "fileFormats": [{"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2022-0163-0338/attachment_2.pdf", "format": "pdf", "size": 315789}], "modifyDate": "2022-12-05T09:55:47Z", "publication": null, "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "title": "Structural Racism with Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine  Final 12.1.2022"}}, {"id": "090000648551a1fb", "type": "attachments", "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/attachments/090000648551a1fb"}, "attributes": {"agencyNote": null, "authors": null, "docAbstract": null, "docOrder": 3, "fileFormats": [{"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2022-0163-0338/attachment_3.pdf", "format": "pdf", "size": 454466}], "modifyDate": "2022-12-05T09:55:48Z", "publication": null, "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "title": "Medicare LCD without historic documents"}}, {"id": "090000648551a1fc", "type": "attachments", "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/attachments/090000648551a1fc"}, "attributes": {"agencyNote": null, "authors": null, "docAbstract": null, "docOrder": 4, "fileFormats": [{"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2022-0163-0338/attachment_4.pdf", "format": "pdf", "size": 4531813}], "modifyDate": "2022-12-05T09:55:49Z", "publication": null, "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "title": "Historic document final"}}]}
