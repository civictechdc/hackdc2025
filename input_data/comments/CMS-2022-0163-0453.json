This has been important because of interactions with people especially of the opposite gender and the type of relationship I want to be able to have with a medical provider.  The gender listed for the provider is called &quot;Administrative gender&quot; and is not otherwise defined by HL7 or FHIR.  Currently activists and the US government and other governments, are effacing the facts of our biology in favor of an individual&#39;s preference for another gender.  I would ask that the group creating this directory should be very clear that a person&#39;s gender (calling it birth gender is nonsensical) is clearly identified.  As a patient it is my right to be able to find a provider who is in fact the gender that they claim to be.  There are multiple ways to express gender in HL7 and this group could allow those different with a clear meaning.  This would make it easy for everyone to understand what their provider is, in a fundamental way.  What I am asking is that the gender be defined clearly and if necessary an alternate gender expression can be provided so that a patient who is looking for a provider could easily see the gender and also see if that person likes to be viewed as the other sex/gender.", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Anonymous", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551d531", "lastName": "Anonymous", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:05:55Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-05T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbb-qrap-lups", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0453/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0453/attachments"}}}}}
