An NDH will benefit providers as they can validate and update information in one place versus the many separate systems currently in use. Additionally, an NDH will benefit individuals seeking care as they can identify providers that can best address their needs. We encourage CMS to consider appropriate security requirements, restricting which information is publicly available versus which data elements are only visible to agencies or contractors with a business need. We welcome additional conversations with CMS about the future of an NDH and how we may support its development.
