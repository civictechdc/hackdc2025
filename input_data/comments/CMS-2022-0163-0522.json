We approach this issue as patient-centered advocates working to end medical harm through transparency and accountability. Our comments therefore focus on the public accessibility and usability of information in an NDH.<br/>    Having a publicly accessible listing of all doctors working in the country is a basic foundational resource needed to enable a health care system to function well and serve patients. Fundamentally, the NDH needs to be built so that the identifier for each doctor is truly unique and is used throughout our health care system. This is long overdue, and we believe it cannot be accomplished without a mandate to do so. Having common identifiers is the foundation for building a system that is efficient, accurate and makes information easily accessible to all healthcare stakeholders.<br/>    We support a phased approach to building the NDH that looks beyond initial implementation&mdash; including activities to &ldquo;assess statutory authorities and take appropriate action&rdquo; to address barriers to full implementation of a robust NDH. Eventually all health care providers (not just physicians) should be included in the NDH. This presents an unprecedented opportunity to streamline oversight and public reporting by bringing together information from other state and federal agencies that oversee the quality and safety of health care providers. While it is essential to build the foundation of the NDH, please keep an eye on this future potential of the NDH.<br/>    Our full comments are attached.
