Each year, Planned Parenthood health centers provide affordable birth control, lifesaving cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and other essential care to more than two million patients. Planned Parenthood health centers also provide abortion services and ensure that people have accurate information about all of their reproductive health care options. One in five women in the U.S. has visited a Planned Parenthood health center. The majority of Planned Parenthood patients have incomes at or below 150 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Planned Parenthood affiliates are small, nonprofit safety net providers and provide essential care in their communities. The stigmatized&ndash;and now criminalized&ndash;nature of some of this care gives Planned Parenthood a unique perspective on the need to protect our providers, as well as the competing need for patients to know which providers offer the services they require.<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "09000064855201ad", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:08:18Z", "organization": "Planned Parenthood Federation of America", "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbc-rgl7-nyat", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [{"id": "09000064855201ae", "type": "attachments"}], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0606/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0606/attachments"}}}}, "included": [{"id": "09000064855201ae", "type": "attachments", "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/attachments/09000064855201ae"}, "attributes": {"agencyNote": null, "authors": null, "docAbstract": null, "docOrder": 1, "fileFormats": [{"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2022-0163-0606/attachment_1.pdf", "format": "pdf", "size": 113351}], "modifyDate": "2022-12-06T17:06:12Z", "publication": null, "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "title": "Provider Directory Comments 12.6.22"}}]}
