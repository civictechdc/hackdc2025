Over the last decade, our organization has worked with stakeholders across the industry to provide data management services and understand the challenges of an accurate and actionable provider directory. The data a patient needs to find a provider is very different from the information payers require from providers, or providers require from each other. Our deep consumer research and focus on connecting patients with care highlights four types of information people need when choosing a provider: clinical, financial, personal and availability. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Clinical: The specialty of a provider is important, but so are the conditions. An orthopedist may be the right speciality, but if a provider specializes in hands <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>and the patient needs a knee replacement that provider doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;match&rdquo; for the patient.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Financial: The cost to the consumer for care.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Personal:  Addressing the unique, personal needs of a patient beyond the convenience of physical location is also critical, such as languages spoken or <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>support for very personal elements for the patient including ability to treat LGBTQ+ patients. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Availability: If a provider isn&rsquo;t accepting new patients, or doesn&rsquo;t have availability for six months, they may not be the right provider match. <br/><br/>Kyruus would welcome the chance to contribute a consumer-focused dataset and approach to any future projects CMS engages in around this space, and appreciate the opportunity to share our thoughts in response to the RFI document in the attached document. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/>Graham Gardner <br/>Chief Executive Officer <br/>Kyruus, Inc<br/>", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551f094", "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:06:43Z", "organization": "Kyruus Inc.", "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbc-hjiv-ljvr", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [{"id": "090000648551f095", "type": "attachments"}], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0504/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0504/attachments"}}}}, "included": [{"id": "090000648551f095", "type": "attachments", "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/attachments/090000648551f095"}, "attributes": {"agencyNote": null, "authors": null, "docAbstract": null, "docOrder": 1, "fileFormats": [{"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2022-0163-0504/attachment_1.pdf", "format": "pdf", "size": 169437}], "modifyDate": "2022-12-06T12:28:32Z", "publication": null, "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "title": "Attachment1_Kyruus Response"}}]}
