Sex is real - it&rsquo;s one of the most important biological markers an individual has.  Gender is nebulous, quasi-religious, it&rsquo;s something akin to a feeling one has about oneself, and has no objective reality like sex. All Americans know what sex is- we all have a sex, whereas gender is highly subjective, and is not fixed, it can change willy nilly and has no basis in science, or medicine. Sex is binary, sex matters not gender. Again don&rsquo;t cave to these gender ideologues, who live in a fantasy world where sex doesn&rsquo;t matter, and gender reigns supreme.  Americans have a right to know the sex of the doctor they choose ,anything less smacks of deception.", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Anonymous", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006485519cf9", "lastName": "Anonymous", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:03:59Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-05T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lba-vybo-ikc3", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0331/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0331/attachments"}}}}}
