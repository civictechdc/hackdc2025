Patients have a right to refuse treatment from people of the opposite sex, no matter how they identify. Doctors and others expected to come into close or intimate contact with others have a right to refuse to perform those services for those of the opposite sex. It is honestly exasperating that such a comment even needs to be submitted. Please do your duty to the entirety of the citizenry by recognizing a shared perception of the truth. I promise even those screaming the loudest in protest will ultimately be benefitted by a society that encourages truth telling in health care and all other facets of common life.", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "J", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551b98a", "lastName": "Meekins", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:05:10Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-05T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lbb-anp3-71jh", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0406/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0406/attachments"}}}}}
