I work as a psychologist in clinical and forensic practice and sexual abuse of women and girls by male practitioners  is common and a significant risk for women and children.  Gender is not an equivalent category. Evidence is mounting that biological males who identify as women are committing sexual and physical assaults of vulnerable women  in prisons, medical facilities and other locations.  These female-identifying males as a group display a pattern of violent criminality that follows male patterns rather than female.  Most sex crimes are never reported due to the lack of support and stigma displayed by law enforcement and the courts. This means that for practical purposes, sex abuse is de facto not illegal.  One way women can and do protect themselves and their children is to select biologically female practitioners.  Failure to allow these protective choices, or to suggest that reality-based androphobia is discriminatory will without a doubt increase crimes against women and children in healthcare settings, even if these offenses are not counted in official statistics.  Please consider that women and children&rsquo;s bodily and psychological safety be prioritized over transgender ideologies.  Humans cannot change biological sex.<br/>Julia Curcio Alexander, PhD", "country": "United States", "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Julia", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "0900006485519c10", "lastName": "Curcio Alexander", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-08T16:03:56Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-08T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-05T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": "PA", "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lba-vdko-jkxt", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0328/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0328/attachments"}}}}}
