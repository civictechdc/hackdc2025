At times when I need intimate care, whether for a hospital stay or for gynecological appointments, I request female-only healthcare providers, as I would be fearful, stressed, and statistically at a much higher risk for sexual assault if my healthcare provider were male, no matter what their claimed gender. My healthcare provider&#39;s claimed gender/pronouns do not matter to me, but their chromosomal sex does.<br/><br/>Hiding the biological sex of providers puts women and children at risk and increases female patients&#39; distress and reluctance to seek medical care with no public benefit. Female patients should be given accurate and useful information, including whether they are taking on additional risk, and permitted to consent or decline to consent to have a male provider touching their bodies, to make the best possible medical care decisions for themselves. Gender is irrelevant in this situation.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.", "country": null, "displayProperties": [{"name": "pageCount", "label": "Page Count", "tooltip": "Number of pages In the content file"}], "docAbstract": null, "docketId": "CMS-2022-0163", "documentType": "Public Submission", "email": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": null, "firstName": "Anonymous", "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "objectId": "090000648551914f", "lastName": "Anonymous", "legacyId": null, "modifyDate": "2022-12-06T14:52:34Z", "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": null, "pageCount": 1, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2022-12-06T05:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2022-12-05T05:00:00Z", "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "stateProvinceRegion": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Public Comment", "title": "Comment on CMS-2022-0163-0001", "trackingNbr": "lba-dkfb-qgu5", "withdrawn": false, "zip": null, "openForComment": false}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"data": [], "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0295/relationships/attachments", "related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/CMS-2022-0163-0295/attachments"}}}}}
