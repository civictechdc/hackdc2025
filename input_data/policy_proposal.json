  "policy_text": "This policy aims to transition 50% of the nation's energy production to renewable sources by 2035. It proposes tax incentives for solar panel installation, subsidies for wind farm development, and stricter regulations on fossil fuel emissions. The primary objective is to reduce carbon footprint and promote sustainable development. It is expected to create 100,000 new jobs in the renewable sector but may lead to a temporary increase in energy costs."
