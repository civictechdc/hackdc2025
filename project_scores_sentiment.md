## Methodology Notes

**Data Sources:** 6 judge evaluation forms submitted between 2025-08-02 and 2025-08-05

**Project Name Standardization:** Some judges used different names for the same projects:

- `llmgov` = "CMS Docket Assistant"
- `rules-talk` = "Talk to me in Rules"
- `taskmasters` = "Data Quality & Derived Layers"
- `the-scrapers` = "FCC & SEC Web Scraping"

**Weighted Scoring Formula:** `(ImpactÃ—0.2 + NoveltyÃ—0.2 + AmplificationÃ—0.15 + OpenSourceÃ—0.15 + UsabilityÃ—0.15 + ContinuityÃ—0.15) Ã— 20`

**Missing Evaluations:** Some judge-project combinations were not evaluated due to event logistics, technical issues, or presentation scheduling.
