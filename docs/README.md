# Things to Hack On & Context

## Context

Regulations.gov hosts tens of millions of public comments, dockets, and supporting documents that shape U.S. federal rule‑making, but access to the data is slow and cumbersome. The **Mirrulations** project mirrors this dataset to a public S3 bucket (\~2.3 TB), enabling faster, easier access. This opens opportunities for researchers, advocacy groups, journalists, and agencies to tackle challenges in finding, interpreting, and linking this data to policy outcomes.

Feedback from nonprofits, public‑health policy analysts, and civic technologists converges on inter‑related challenges that make regulatory engagement slow, costly, and opaque.

## The Data Lake: A Technical Overview of the Mirrulations Ecosystem

Mirrulations (MIRRor of regULATIONS.gov) is a comprehensive ecosystem developed by [Moravian University Computer Science](https://www.moravian.edu/computer-science) to ingest, process, store, and serve U.S. federal regulatory data from Regulations.gov. It provides a robust, scalable, and accessible way for researchers, developers, and the public to interact with this complex dataset. The system overcomes the API’s 1,000 items/hour limit by using donated API keys to maintain a continuously updated mirror — about 27 million items — including text extracted from PDFs.

**Data Access: [s3://mirrulations](https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-registry/blob/main/datasets/mirrulations.yaml)** At its core is the public S3 bucket `s3://mirrulations`, part of the AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program. This bucket hosts JSON files representing dockets, documents, and comments, as well as associated binary attachments (PDFs and more).

**Direct-Access Toolkit for Researchers** For users working directly with raw data, Mirrulations provides standalone command-line utilities:

- [**mirrulations-fetch**](https://github.com/mirrulations/mirrulations-fetch)**:** Download all data for a specific docket ID from the S3 bucket to a local machine with a simple command.  
- [**docket-stats (mirrulations-query)**](https://github.com/mirrulations/mirrulations-query)**:** Validate data completeness by comparing counts of dockets, documents, and comments in S3 against the live Regulations.gov API.  
- [**mirrulations-csv**](https://github.com/mirrulations/mirrulations-csv)**:** Convert downloaded comment JSON files into a single, clean CSV file, intelligently excluding empty or constant fields to simplify downstream analysis.

*For details on how the data is organized (dockets, documents, comments, attachments, and extraction outputs), see the [Mirrulations data structure reference](https://github.com/MoravianUniversity/mirrulations-data/blob/main/structure.md).*

## Problem Themes

### Data Accessibility & Cost

- **Pain:** The mirrored data is large, highly structured, and JSON‑heavy, making it inconvenient for data analysis.  

- **Stakeholder Quotes:**  

  - “Accessing all the data in this format can be slow, but it’s way better than Regulations.gov.”  
  - “What can we build on top of the raw Mirrulations data… leveraging free S3 and open‑source tools?”

- **Need:**  

  - Efficient formats (Parquet/ORC) for scalable storage and querying.  
  - Lightweight, local‑friendly pipelines (DuckDB, SQLite).

**Details:** [download‑tool improvement](./additional_problem_details/download_tools.md)

---

### Scraping Specific Agency Comment Systems

- **Pain:** Outside [Regulations.gov](https://regulations.gov), public‑comment data is scattered across agency‑specific systems with inconsistent formats, making scraping and analysis slow and error‑prone.  

- **Current State:** Agencies such as FCC, FERC, SEC, USITC, CFTC, FTC, and NLRB operate their own portals.  

- **Need:**  

  - Build scraping scripts for agency systems (e.g., FCC’s ECFS API).  
  - Deliver clear, standardized data formats (JSON) for comments and attachments.

**Details:** [scraping regulations that are *not* on Regulations.gov](./additional_problem_details/external_agency_scraping.md)

---

### Data Quality & Derived Layers

- **Pain:** Derived data is incomplete and low‑quality.  

- **Stakeholder Quote:** “Data already exists — could be better… what derived format would be optimal?”  

- **Current State:** Most dockets have “derived” data via Mirrulations, but only PDFs are parsed; extraction quality is low and unstructured.  

- **Need:**  

  - Higher‑quality structured extraction for PDFs, Word docs, images, and HTML.  
  - Normalize text extraction across formats.  
  - Integrate with **Position & Sentiment Analysis** modules.

---

### Docket-Level Analysis

- **Pain:** Single dockets (e.g., DEA‑2024‑0059) can contain tens of thousands of comments; final rules reference commenters only abstractly.  

- **Stakeholder Quote:** "How can we summarize key themes, arguments, and sentiments from thousands of comments on a single rule?"  

- **Need:** LLM‑powered thematic clustering and sentiment analysis pipelines.

**Details:**

- [linking comments from Proposed Rule to Final Rule](./additional_problem_details/rule_backlinking.md)  
- [coordinated comment detection](./additional_problem_details/campaign_detection.md)

---

### Cross-Docket & Version-Aware Analysis

- **Pain:** No global search or cross‑linking of related dockets; difficult to map RFIs → Proposed Rules → Final Rules or track rule evolution across years.  

- **Stakeholder Quotes:**  

  - “Global docket search… filtering by agency.”  
  - “How are dockets related?”

- **Need:**  

  - Cross‑docket mapping with thematic and phase linkages.  
  - Version‑aware tracking of iterative rules and comment cycles.  
  - Topical graphing: build a “connected dockets” dataset in S3.  
  - Semantic enrichment to expand keyword searches.

**Details:**

- [regulatory sequence map](./additional_problem_details/docket_mapping.md)  
- [topic extraction for regulatory terms](./additional_problem_details/topic_sentiment.md)  
- [commenter threads across dockets](./additional_problem_details/cross_docket_commenter_threads.md)

---

### Entity Resolution

- **Pain:** Organization names are messy and inconsistent, obscuring who submitted comments.  

- **Stakeholder Quotes:**  

  - “Make it easier to determine which organizations submitted comments.”  
  - “We need entity disambiguation.”

- **Need:** Canonical entity resolution to unify aliases and classify entities (advocacy, industry, etc.).

**Details:** [entity map of regulatory commenters](./additional_problem_details/entity_mapping.md)

---

### Campaign Detection

- **Pain:** Duplicate or campaign‑driven comments inflate counts and obscure genuine engagement.  

- **Stakeholder Quote:** “Track campaigns.”  

- **Need:**  

  - Identify duplicates, irrelevant submissions, templates, and AI‑ or bot‑generated comments.  
  - Extract unique text as the signal.

**Starter Idea:** [detecting bots via submission times](./additional_problem_details/bot_detection.md)

---

### Position & Sentiment Analysis

- **Pain:** Binary “for/against” coding misses nuance; manual consensus measurement is error‑prone.  

- **Stakeholder Quotes:**  

  - “Sophisticated position analysis… can we use LLMs?”  
  - “How many credible commenters made similar points?”

- **Need:**  

  - Extract and cluster positions.  
  - Quantify shared stances.  
  - Summarize clusters.

---

### Influence Mapping & Feedback Loops

- **Pain:** Agencies summarize comments but rarely cite specifics, leaving commenters unsure of impact.  

- **Stakeholder Quotes:**  

  - “Develop tools to assess whether and how comments influenced the final rule.”  
  - “Which entities actually impact regulatory filings?”

- **Need:**  

  - Proposed → final diffing with regulator responses.  
  - Influence scoring.  
  - Feedback loops so organizations can benchmark and refine engagement.

---

### Usability for Non-Technical Stakeholders

- **Pain:** Advocates, journalists, and coalition staff struggle with Regulations.gov and lack digestible reports.  

- **Stakeholder Quotes:**  

  - "Help non‑experts discover adjacent topics."  
  - "How can we develop interactive visualizations that help policy analysts and the public quickly understand patterns?"

- **Need:**  

  - Interactive dashboards of patterns, consensus, and trends.  
  - Guided semantic search.  
  - Automated sector‑specific digests.

**Details:** [LLM ingestion and Q&A](./additional_problem_details/llm_integration.md)

---

### Regulatory Document Discovery & Navigation

- **Pain:** Near‑identical, lengthy rule titles obscure key differences; critical provisions are buried without clear sign‑posting.  

- **Stakeholder Quote:** “Out of the 400+ pages, I'm interested in about 5\. If I didn't know what I was looking for, I never would have found the sections that impact public‑health data exchange.”  

- **Need:**  

  - AI‑generated section summaries with topic tags.  
  - Cross‑rule topic indexing (“public‑health reporting” → specific pages across all rules).

- **Impact:** Upstream discovery problems mean stakeholders miss commenting opportunities before they begin — making downstream comment‑analysis tools irrelevant if users can’t find what to comment on.

---

# Other Needs

## Emerging Additive Needs

- Semantic enrichment & onboarding to teach new users adjacent topics and common terms in a regulatory domain.  
- Topical graphing to store and expose "connected dockets" as a browsable dataset.  
- Entity threads across rules to track an organization's regulatory engagement longitudinally.  
- Advanced coordination/fraud detection using text similarity, timing analysis, and submission clustering.  
- Proposed → final rule diffing that combines comment clusters with regulator responses to pinpoint influence and adoption.  
- Scalable LLM pipelines that adapt proven API‑driven approaches for summarization, topic mining, and cross‑docket analysis.

## Where Mirrulations Helps & Where Gaps Remain

| Strengths | Gaps |
| :---- | :---- |
| • Mirrored data available in public S3. | • No semantic enrichment or topical graphing. |
| • [Example repo with API & OpenSearch for full‑text search.](https://github.com/mirrulations/dev) | • No entity resolution or longitudinal tracking. |
| • Structured PostgreSQL metadata. | • No consensus measurement or influence mapping. |
|  | • No user‑facing dashboards or guided search. |

## Bottom Line

Stakeholders need affordable, enriched, and accessible pipelines that transform Regulations.gov data from a raw mirror into an actionable civic resource:

- **Policy analysts:** Find partner organizations' comments, measure consensus, and receive sector‑specific digests.  
- **Advocates & journalists:** Detect coordinated campaigns and emerging issues using text‑plus‑timing analysis.  
- **Agencies & NGOs:** Trace comment influence, evaluate feedback adoption, and generate compliance‑ready summaries to inform better engagement strategies.

This landscape provides a blueprint for prioritizing MVP pipelines (entity resolution, semantic search, consensus counting) while charting long‑term goals (influence mapping, advanced coordination detection, cross‑docket and cross‑platform graphs).

## Form Submissions (CSV)

### Visualizing Comment Data for Policy Analysis

- **Submitted:** 23 Jul 2025 15:38  
- **Submitter:** *Yashin Lin*  
- **Problem / Challenge:** "How can we develop interactive visualizations that help policy analysts and the public quickly understand patterns, trends, and outliers within a large dataset of public comments?"  
- **Why It Matters:** "Raw data, even clean data, can be overwhelming. Effective visualizations (e.g., temporal trends of comments, geographical distribution of commenters, network graphs of related organizations) could unlock insights and improve public understanding of the rule‑making process."  
- **Desired Solution:** Interactive visual dashboards showing temporal, geographic, and relational patterns in comment data.  
- **Participation Availability:** Potentially available.

---

### Summarizing Large Volumes of Comments

- **Submitted:** 23 Jul 2025 15:40  

- **Submitter:** *Yashin Lin*  

- **Problem / Challenge:**  

  1. Same visualization need as above.  
  2. "How can we effectively and accurately summarize the key themes, arguments, and sentiments from thousands or tens of thousands of public comments on a single proposed rule?"

- **Why It Matters:** "Agencies are required to consider comments, but manually sifting through vast quantities is impractical. Automated summarization, perhaps using NLP techniques, could dramatically improve efficiency and understanding of public input."  

- **Desired Solution:** NLP‑driven thematic and sentiment summaries.  

- **Participation Availability:** Potentially available.

### How Common Is the Feedback?

- **Submitted:** 25 Jul 2025 14:04  

- **Submitter:** *Melanie Kourbage* — Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL)  

- **Problem / Challenge:** "It is often difficult to locate comments from sister organizations on Regulations.gov, even when I know they submitted them… We strongly suspect that partner organizations made similar points, but verifying this is challenging. For instance, CMS recently solicited comments via an RFI embedded in the CMS IPPS Proposed Rule for 2026. Approximately how many credible commenters made a similar point? Can we analyze the data to see how often those dataflows were referenced and produce a digestible report?"  

- **Why It Matters:**  

  1. Locate other partner organizations that may have commented on similar rules.  
  2. Measure how engaged partner organizations are in the commenting process.  
  3. Identify emerging issues by analyzing how organizations are shifting focus.

- **Need:** End‑to‑end entity‑resolution pipeline for normalizing, classifying, and grouping commenters by organizational type.  

- **Relevant Link:** [https://www.regulations.gov/document/CMS-2025-0028-0013/comment](https://www.regulations.gov/document/CMS-2025-0028-0013/comment)  

- **Participation Availability:** Potentially available (logo opt‑out).

## Email Submissions (Verbatim Excerpts)

### Potential Use Cases / Problem Statements

**Identifying commenters:** Make it easier to determine which organizations submitted comments and categorize them by type (advocacy, industry, academia, individuals).

**Analyzing comment content:** Enable better analysis of how many organizations commented on specific topics or themes.

**Tracking impact:** Develop tools to assess whether and how submitted comments influenced the final rule (e.g., whether particular suggestions were accepted or addressed).

### Influence of Comments on Final Rules

“I’d love to know how often and how substantively rules actually change in response to comments — and whether certain areas of law are more likely to change or stay the same regardless of what comments are submitted. How much do comments actually influence the final rules? I’d also be interested in how agencies use RFIs before proposed rules.”

### Desired Insights From Comments

“Your focus on impact resonates. In a nutshell, this is what I want to get out of the comments:

• What did other organizations say? Did they make similar points to ours? Did we miss any obvious points? • What changed in the final rule, and were there comments suggesting that change? • APHL often submits the same feedback repeatedly, especially on annually updated rules. We must ask whether it's worth submitting if our recommendations aren't adopted, or whether we should re‑frame feedback. We've met with some federal agencies to get insight, but with mixed success."

### Case Study: USCDI V6 Platform Challenges

“USCDI V6 uses a separate platform, not Regulations.gov, to collect feedback, amplifying existing problems. Commenters must respond to data elements one by one. We submitted at least a dozen comments in May for V6. There’s a separate submission process to add or remove a data element. The platform saves all comments on all previous USCDI versions (V1‑V6), which is both good and bad. I just compared the final V6 standard to our comments and found none adopted. Several NGOs submitted comments; I don’t know whether theirs were addressed. I would be ecstatic if AI could handle this comparison.”

### Additional Notes on Regulation Titles & Market Opportunity

“First, the titles are a nightmare. Three CMS proposed rules dropped within 60 days. If I didn’t know what I was looking for, I never would have found the sections that impact public‑health data exchange and reporting.”

### Fragmented Federal Comment Systems

Several major agencies host comments outside Regulations.gov:

| Agency | System |
| :---- | :---- |
| FCC | ECFS |
| SEC | Internal website / email |
| FERC | eFiling & eComment |
| USITC | EDIS |
| STB | Environmental & docket portals |
| FTC | Public Comments page |
| NRC | ADAMS archive (post‑Regulations.gov) |
| CFTC | Comment portal |
| CFPB | Mixed systems |
| NLRB | Electronic filing |

*Challenge:* Scrape the various portals and produce data aligned with the Mirrulations ecosystem to strengthen the broader dataset.
