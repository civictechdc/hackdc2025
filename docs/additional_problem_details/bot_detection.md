## Tool: Detecting Bots Using Submission Times

### Problem

Some comments on regulatory dockets may be submitted by bots, obscuring authentic public engagement. Analyzing submission timing patterns can help distinguish automated from organic submissions.

### Initial Analysis

Preliminary findings suggest that bot activity can be detected by examining the **regularity of comment posting times**. Consistent, highly patterned submission intervals often indicate automated processes.

### Proposed Tool

A program that:

1. Accepts a set of “matching” comment texts (e.g., duplicates or near-duplicates).
2. Analyzes the **submission timestamps** for this subset of comments.
3. Identifies whether the pattern aligns with automated submission behavior.
4. Generates detailed statistics about these submission patterns (e.g., intervals, bursts, anomalies).

### Potential Outcome

A statistical report flagging comment clusters likely generated by bots, enabling regulators, researchers, and analysts to filter out fraudulent or low-quality input and focus on authentic public engagement.

**Goal:** Improve data quality by detecting and quantifying automated comment submissions using time-based analysis.
