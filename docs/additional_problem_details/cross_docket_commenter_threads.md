## Across Docket Dataset: Commenter Threads Across Rules

### Problem

Entities often submit comments on multiple regulatory topics over time, but tracking these “commenter threads” across different dockets is challenging. Variations in language, political framing, or terminology make it difficult to identify consistent engagement across rules.

### Key Requirement

This effort depends on solving **entity resolution** — accurately identifying and unifying organizations and individuals across datasets, even when they use different names or identifiers.

### Proposed Approach

* Build a **cross-docket commenter map** showing where entities have engaged across different rules.
* Use topic mapping to track when entities discuss similar ideas using different language or framing.
* Leverage this data to “crowdsource” the connections between related regulatory topics.

### Potential Outcome

An enriched dataset providing:

* **Commenter engagement threads** across multiple dockets.
* Insights into how entities evolve their positions or influence across regulatory domains.

**Goal:** Enable analysts, advocates, and policymakers to trace how organizations engage over time, surfacing connections that may be obscured by changing language or shifting political context.
