By extracting data from a wide variety of document formats including PDFs, images, and text documents our project ensures that valuable information contained in unstructured or hard to access files becomes accessible and analyzable. This directly addresses the challenge of inconsistent and fragmented data quality found in public comment datasets.

Additionally, by implementing keyword extraction on comments, we enable the identification of major themes, trends, and important topics within large volumes of public feedback. This approach transforms raw, unorganized data into structured, meaningful insights, helping stakeholders quickly understand public sentiment and key issues relevant to proposed rules or policies.

Together, these solutions improve data quality, increase usability for data analysis, and empower decision-makers to draw actionable conclusions from previously underutilized data sources.

Apart from this, we are also converting the json file to parquet format, which will result in faster querying. All of this done using AWS S3, Glue, and Athena services.
