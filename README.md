# Civic Hack DC 2025 ‚Äì Part 1: Making Public Comments Count ‚Äì Outcomes & Archive

## üåü Acknowledgments

We first want to thank the volunteers and participants who made this hackathon possible. The amount of work that went into this was incredible, and we are grateful for the time and effort that everyone put in.

### Sponsors

- **CareSet**(<https://careset.com/>)
- **Taoti Creative**(<https://taoti.com/>)
- **Prefect**(<https://prefect.io/>)
- **Thunder Compute**(<https://thundercompute.com/>)
- **TealWolf Consulting**(<https://tealwolf.consulting/>)

### Partners

- **Moravian University**(<https://www.moravian.edu/>) - Maintaining the Regulations.gov mirror dataset
- **DataKindDC**(<https://www.meetup.com/datakind-dc/>)

This hackathon was made possible by our sponsors, partners, the judging panel, and all participants who dedicated their time and creativity to building tools for regulatory transparency.

## 1 ¬∑ Why This Repository Exists

On July 26 2025, 90 policy experts, data engineers, and civic technologists gathered at **Taoti Creative** to build **open-source tools** that unlock public-comment data from *Regulations.gov* and agency-specific portals.

This repo now serves as the **permanent archive**:

- final project snapshots  
- judging results & slide decks  
- cleaned datasets & helper scripts  
- the original problem briefs (for future contributors)  

Everything is licensed to encourage reuse and continuation.

## 2 ¬∑ Key Dataset ‚Äì Mirrulations üåä

Mirrulations (MIRRor of regULATIONS.gov) is a comprehensive ecosystem developed by [Moravian University Computer Science](https://www.moravian.edu/computer-science) to ingest, process, store, and serve U.S. federal regulatory data from Regulations.gov. It provides a robust, scalable, and accessible way for researchers, developers, and the public to interact with this complex dataset. The system overcomes the API‚Äôs 1,000 items/hour limit by using donated API keys to maintain a continuously updated mirror ‚Äî about 27 million items ‚Äî including text extracted from PDFs.

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| **Bucket** | `s3://mirrulations` (AWS Open-Data) |
| **Size** | ‚âà 2.3 TB / 27 M items (JSON + attachments) |
| **Docs** | <https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-registry/blob/main/datasets/mirrulations.yaml> |
| **CLI** | `mirrulations-fetch`, `mirrulations-query`, `mirrulations-csv` |
| **Contact** | Prof. Ben Coleman ‚Ä¢ <colemanb@moravian.edu> |

Mirrulations mirrors *Regulations.gov* hourly, bypassing the API‚Äôs 1 000-items/h throttle and extracting text from PDFs so teams can *gulp* data at scale.

There is a [sample slice of the dataset](./datasets/README.md) in this repo.

## 3 ¬∑ What were the problem statements?

| Track                                 | Problem - How can we ...                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entity Resolution**                 | identify and unify organization names across dockets, accounting for aliases and inconsistent naming conventions?                           |
| **Campaign Detection**                | detect duplicate or template-driven comment submissions, including coordinated campaigns and potential bot activity?                        |
| **Position & Sentiment Analysis**     | extract nuanced positions and sentiments from comments beyond simple for/against categorizations?                                           |
| **Influence Mapping**                 | link public comments to specific changes in final rules and identify which commenters influenced regulatory outcomes?                       |
| **Docket-Level Analysis**             | build clear, digestible summaries and insights from tens of thousands of comments within a single docket?                                   |
| **Cross-Docket Analysis**             | map related dockets (RFI ‚Üí Proposed Rule ‚Üí Final Rule) and enable search across multiple agencies and rulemaking cycles?                    |
| **Data Accessibility**                | make the mirrored Regulations.gov dataset easier to explore and analyze for researchers and non-technical stakeholders?                     |
| **Agency-Specific Data**              | scrape, integrate, and standardize public comment data from non-Regulations.gov portals (e.g., FCC, SEC, FERC)?                             |
| **Usability for Non-Technical Users** | create interfaces, visualizations, or summaries that make complex regulatory data understandable to advocates, journalists, and the public? |
| **Regulatory Document Navigation**    | surface and summarize the most relevant sections of lengthy, technical regulatory documents to support timely public engagement?            |

For more details, see the [Problem Space Documentation](./docs/README.md).

## 5 ¬∑ Judging Criteria

This is not a competition, but we will judge asynchronously to decide which projects to feature, and we'll raffle off prizes to the top 3 projects.

Projects were evaluated based on the following dimensions:

Projects are scored on a 1‚Äì5 scale in each category and then multiplied by the weight shown below.

- **Impact & Relevance** ‚Äì Directly tackles an official problem statement and demonstrates clear civic value or policy impact.
- **Novelty** ‚Äì How unique is the approach? How does it differ from existing tools?
- **Amplification** ‚Äì What is the potential for this project to be used by others?
- **Open Source Practices** ‚Äì Public repo with an OSI‚Äëapproved license, focus on open-source tool usage, thorough README, install script, contribution guide, and passing tests/CI.
- **Usability & Design** ‚Äì Non‚Äëtechnical users can run the tool or interpret results unaided; thoughtful UX or reporting artifacts provided.
- **Continuity Potential** ‚Äì Road‚Äëmap or issues list, maintainers committed, and a deployment or next‚Äësteps plan that makes ongoing work realistic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Subtree vs Submodule Strategy

We use **git subtrees** with squashed history for hackathon snapshots because they:

- Preserve working code even if original repos disappear
- Allow simple cloning without extra commands
- Keep repository size manageable

For active development, teams can optionally add submodules alongside subtrees.

## ü§ù Post-Hackathon Continuity

This hackathon is only the beginning.

- **Next Steps:** We'll be working on part 2 of the hackathon, which will be announced soon for the fall or spring.
- **Project Archive:** All team projects are archived in `/projects` as subtrees, preserving a snapshot even if upstream repos disappear.
- **Ongoing Development:** We‚Äôll showcase standout projects at Civic Tech DC meetups and help connect teams with partners to keep building.
- **Join Us:** Stay involved through [Civic Tech DC meetups](https://www.civictechdc.org/) and our Slack (see `/docs/` for invite).
